<li>Service Providers. We may share your information with third party service providers who use this information to perform services for us, such as payment processors, hosting providers, auditors, advisors, contractors and consultants. In addition, The Linux Foundation performs services for OPenJS Foundation as a managed services provider with regards to our Projects. In such cases, we may share with The Linux Foundation the same types of data as described above, doing so in the furtherance of performing Services for those Projects. The Linux Foundation’s privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/privacy/">https://www.linuxfoundation.org/privacy/</a>.</li>
<li>Organizational Events.

If you register for an event, we may ask for your consent to share your personal information with third party sponsors and other participants; for example, to facilitate your ability to swipe your badge to easily sign up for or participate in activities, events and gifts offered by third parties participating in the event, or to give you the option to be listed on the attendee list that is available to other attendee, sponsors and participants.  We will not share your event information with third parties without your consent, and in particular you have the choice whether or not to permit your badge to be swiped by any third party participating in the event.</li>

<h2 id="header-data-security">Data Security<a id="data-security" class="anchor" href="#data-security" aria-labelledby="header-data-security"></a></h2><p>We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions designed to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your passwords, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing robust passwords that nobody else knows or can easily guess, not using a password for more than one site or service, and keeping your log-ins and passwords private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.  We ask you to promptly notify us if you become aware that any information provided by or submitted to our Sites or through our Services is lost, stolen, or used without permission at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bbcbc9d2cddad8c2fbd4cbded5d1c8dd95d4c9dc"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2151534857404258614e51444f4b52470f4e5346">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

However, in some circumstances, we may retain personal information for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required.  In specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal information for longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.</p>
<h2 id="header-international-transfers">International Transfers<a id="international-transfers" class="anchor" href="#international-transfers" aria-labelledby="header-international-transfers"></a></h2><p>If you are located within the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, you should note that your personal information will be transferred to countries outside these jurisdictions, including the United States where OpenJS Foundation is located.

<li>to object to our use and processing of your personal information that is conducted on the basis of our legitimate interest.

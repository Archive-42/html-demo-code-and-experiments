Ever been frustrated by the ancient technology you’re forced to use at the office?

Tech geeks have it especially tough. At home, you’ve always got the latest gadgets. Your smartphone has all the apps you need, you’ve got the latest gizmo in hand shortly after it’s released, and you’ve got your desktop computer hooked up with all of the [peripherals](http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/10_amazing_peripherals_you_didnt_know_you_needed) exactly the way you want them.

But the office is a different story. You live in fear of [carpal tunnel syndrome](http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20030610/typing-rarely-cause-of-carpal-tunnel) from contorting your wrists to type on a flat old keyboard, and your monitor resolution is laughable.

And let’s not get started on the software that you’re stuck with. You’re forced to live without all your browser extensions, and forget about your preferred browser (perhaps you’re even still stuck with [IE6](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488448/internet/ie6--retired-but-not-dead-yet.html)).

Everything would be so much easier if you could just use all your own devices at work

Turns out, many companies are beginning to agree with you.

On the surface, it seems like a no-brainer. You know you’d be more comfortable and work more efficiently using all the devices and configurations that you’re used to. And your company would sure save a lot of time and hassle if employees were allowed to take care of their own devices.

It seems like a great idea in theory… but in practice, it’s a bit more complicated. Some companies have already discovered the pitfalls of sharing information on outside devices — and that’s why it’s so important for companies to develop an official BYOD (bring your own device) policy.

The potential benefits are great — what company couldn’t use an increase in employee morale and efficiency? But when you’re putting the company’s [security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-network-security.html) at risk, those benefits just aren’t worth it.

Want to convince your company to allow you to bring your own laptop to the office, or maybe you’re considering implementing a BYOD policy at your company? Check out the pros and cons below, and follow the guide to create an official policy that will protect your company from any pitfalls.

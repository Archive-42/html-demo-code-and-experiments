It’s hard to believe that until the 2000s, the only way that most people could get online was by hooking up their computers to a phone line or Ethernet cable.

Ironically, the first portable computers were released way before we learned how to unchain ourselves from all those cables.

Believe it or not, the first laptops were released back in the 1980s. Among them was [Apple’s Macintosh Portable](https://time.com/3398919/apple-first-portable-macintosh/), available in 1989 for a retail price of $6500. Weighing in at 16 pounds (over 7 kg), the “portable” computer was later named as one of the [worst tech products ever](https://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html?page=5) invented.

Despite these inauspicious beginnings, the 1990s saw a rise in the popularity of laptops as the technology to create lighter, more portable computers improved, and the devices became much more affordable. However, if you wanted to go online, they weren’t very portable at all.

Wireless internet has been around for a surprisingly long time — it was actually [invented in 1985](http://www.thesuitmagazine.com/technology/web-a-internet/22360-wireless-revolution-the-history-of-wifi.html). But it wasn’t until the 2000s that it started to become increasingly popular.

Today, Wi-Fi is an integral part of our lives. It’s ubiquitous in our homes, and hotspots in hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, and stores. Thanks to modern laptops, and the rise of mobile devices such as tablets and [smartphones](https://gigaom.com/2009/08/18/how-smartphones-are-making-wi-fi-hot-again/), we now use Wi-fi more than ever. Mobile Internet traffic has now [exceeded desktop traffic](http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/), and there are now [more mobile devices](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/there-are-officially-more-mobile-devices-than-people-in-the-world-9780518.html) on the planet than there are human beings. Half of United States citizens now [own tablets or e-readers](http://marketingland.com/pew-50-percent-in-us-now-own-tablet-or-e-reader-70765), and [over half own a smartphone](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/). And [75%](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vala-afshar/50-incredible-wifi-tech-s_b_4775837.html) of people would rather go without coffee for a week than go without Wi-Fi.

However, the downside of Wi-Fi use is all the security vulnerabilities it creates.

Think about the last time you used public Wi-Fi. What information did you send over the network? How much sensitive data was stored on the device you used? Many [unsecured public Wi-fi](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-unvarnished-truth-about-unsecured-wi-fi/) hotspots leave your devices open to hackers who are out to steal your data.

While you may be able to easily spot a spam email or a phishing attempt, some of these Wi-fi hackers are very sneaky — and unsecured public Wi-fi makes their job easy.

Want to keep your device safe while using public Wi-Fi? Here’s how.

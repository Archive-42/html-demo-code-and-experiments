==============================================

HTML.com helps web developers of all stripes and skill levels craft the best HTML and CSS possible.

The amount of information available to today’s developer can be overwhelming, so HTML.com provides coders with comprehensive, easy-to-use references filled with tips, tricks, and techniques.

We strive to be better than the typical developer documentation offerings. In addition to showing you how to use something, we provide information on when and why something should be used. We don’t just assume that you already know everything about HTML.

Don’t get caught out with the changes spurred by HTML5. Know the best way to do something, find out what is now outdated, and what has deprecated in certain browsers.

We help you separate the wheat from the chaff with our up-to-date content, code things correctly the first time, and keep on keeping on.

This website began as HTMLCodeTutorial.com in 2002 —  created as a quick reference to all HTML tags and attributes.

In late 2016, we rebranded the site to HTML.com

The HTML.com team is made up of web developers and technical writers. We all come from different backgrounds, but what we have in common is extensive expertise with all things computers, technology, and the internet.

Some of us are nomads; others, not so much. Most of us have never met each other, but we are nevertheless a close-knit team thanks to the wonders of the internet and its collaboration tools.

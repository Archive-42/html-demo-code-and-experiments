When looking at web hosting options, you’ll see many offering the same perks: “Free domain names and SSL certificates!” “Unlimited disk space and bandwidth!”

Are these the best criteria by which you pick a host? Well, these things may be important, but there are other factors to consider, including:

- Your resource and performance requirements
- The host’s ease of use and plan customizability
- Customer service quality
- Infrastructure reliability and uptime, including money-back guarantees
- Your hosting plan’s scalability and flexibility
- Data security, including backup and restoration services

In the following sections, we’ll take a look at why these factors matter and which ones you may wish to prioritize.

## <span id="The_7_Best_Web_Hosts_of_2019">The 7 Best Web Hosts of 2019</span>

Based on our monitoring of uptime and performance, as well as reviews from users, we’ve identified the following as the best web hosts of 2019.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9188" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="A2_Hosting">A2 Hosting</span>

[A2 Hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/a2-hosting/) is a developer-friendly web hosting company that supports many technologies and languages.

We found A2 Hosting to offer one of the best uptimes, although the response times were on the poor side. In user reviews, customers speak highly of the company’s support team.

On the other hand, A2 Hosting isn’t the cheapest option, it doesn’t offer free domain names, and might not be the easiest for newbies to use.

**Pros**

- Supports many technologies and frameworks
- Excellent uptime
- Free automatic daily backups
- Free SSL certificate
- Free website migrations

**Cons**

- Can be challenging to someone new to web hosting technologies
- Expensive renewal prices

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9190" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="Bluehost">Bluehost</span>

[Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/) is officially recommended by WordPress.org and the company’s beginner-friendly hosting options will appeal to many.

The name of the game at Bluehost is simplicity. The company’s plans are full-featured throughout and come with a custom control panel designed to make website management easy.

Bluehost is faster than A2 Hosting. It will throttle your resource usage if you use too much of the “unlimited” offering, and their support isn’t typically considered best-in-class.

**Pros**

- Many plans to choose from
- Great value for your money
- Includes a CDN and an SSL certificate

**Cons**

- Backups aren’t guaranteed
- A learning curve with the custom control panel

[\[ Decided to try Bluehost? Get our discount. \]](https://html.com/go/bluehost/)

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9191" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="SiteGround">SiteGround</span>

If you want budget-friendly, full-featured hosting plans that come with industry-leading support, look no further than [SiteGround](https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/).

The company offers a variety of web hosting options that you can grow into overtime. They’re known for their WordPress expertise and proprietary security technology powered by artificial intelligence.

The downsides, however, include slightly higher monthly fees.

In our testing, SiteGround’s average server response times are higher than A2 Hosting’s and lower than Bluehost’s or GreenGeeks’.

**Pros**

- Lots of scalable hosting options
- Fast and stable servers
- Reliable 24/7 cross-platform support

**Cons**

- Pricy for newcomers with low requirements
- No site transfer on the base plan
- No free domain name

[\[ Want to try SiteGround? Use our discount. \]](https://html.com/go/siteground/)

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9193" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="HostGator">HostGator</span>

[HostGator](https://html.com/web-hosting/hostgator/) describes its web hosting options as “easy and affordable.” Their plans come with unlimited resource allocations, a 99.9% uptime guarantee, and a generous 45-day money-back guarantee.

Though the company’s offerings aren’t as robust as some of its competitors, HostGator does offer a variety of options that will appeal to many types of customers – beginners and business owners alike.

On the flip side, extras like SiteLock security, downgrades, account restorations, and dedicated IPS (to name a few) cost extra, and the response times are almost half of SiteGround’s.

**Pros**

- 45-day money-back guarantee
- Free Weebly website builder
- Search engine credits included with plans

**Cons**

- No optimized WordPress hosting
- Not HIPAA-compliant
- Fee for restoring backups

[\[ Think HostGator’s right for you? Be sure to get our discount. \]](https://html.com/go/hostgator/)

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9195" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="InMotion_Hosting">InMotion Hosting</span>

[InMotion](https://html.com/web-hosting/inmotion/) is a one-stop-shop for most services website-related, including hosting, domain names, and web design. They even offer design services, an unusual offering, since many hosts only offer DIY tools like website builders.

InMotion is also committed to open source products and offers solid customer service.

The downsides of InMotion, however, include higher price points and lower resource allocations. We also noticed that InMotion is significantly slower than its competitors, with response times exceeding **1,379.5 milliseconds**.

**Pros**

- 90-day money-back guarantee
- Green servers & fast technology
- Outstanding support & documentation

**Cons**

- Datacenters located in North America only
- Priority support comes only with top-tier plans

[\[ Ready to try InMotion Hosting? Get our discount. \]](https://html.com/go/inmotion/)

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9197" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="Squarespace">Squarespace</span>

If you want access to some of the best-looking themes around, an easy-to-use editing interface, in an all-in-one package, [Squarespace](https://html.com/web-hosting/squarespace/) is the option for you.

You’ll also get robust reference materials and good customer service.

The downside, however, is that Squarespace doesn’t offer complete customization of your site, and it’s on the expensive side.

Those with large online stores will likely find the functionality restrictive.

**Pros**

- Beautiful, easy-to-use website builder
- Fully managed server-side
- Excellent support and training materials
- Free 14-day trial

**Cons**

- Pricier than many other hosts, but comes with site builder.
- Phone support not offered

[\[ Decided on Squarespace? Use our discount. \]](https://html.com/go/squarespace/)

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9199" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### <span id="GreenGeeks">GreenGeeks</span>

[GreenGeeks](https://html.com/web-hosting/greengeeks/)‘ unique value proposition is that it is a “green” web host that doesn’t skimp on performance or technology. Their day-to-day operations are fully carbon neutral.

The company states that there are no hidden fees. Customers speak highly of GreenGeeks’ customer service. Average server response times are fastest out of all competitors, and uptimes are impressive too.

However, large enterprises would do well to look elsewhere, since the company doesn’t offer advanced options.

Even if you’re content with shared hosting, you might find GreenGeeks’ plans limited, even at the fairly expensive, top-tier option.

**Pros**

- Eco-friendly – replaces 300% of the energy it consumes
- Free site migration and nightly backups
- Free website builder

**Cons**

- 3-year commitment for lowest prices
- Linux servers only, no Windows servers

## <span id="Types_of_Hosting">Types of Hosting</span>

Before you can choose the best web hosting company for you, you’ll need to determine the _type_ of hosting that fits your needs.

Typically you’ll be deciding between shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated servers, cloud hosting, and [WordPress hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/wordpress/).

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Shared hosting with A2 Hosting." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9427" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Shared hosting with <a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/a2-hosting/">A2 Hosting</a></em>.</figcaption></figure>### <span id="Shared_Hosting">Shared Hosting</span>

Shared hosting is the cheapest option available, with many websites **sharing the resources available on a single server**.

The trade-offs for low prices are smaller resource allocations. And, if you’re on an “unlimited” plan, your host might throttle your traffic if you use too much. You might also experience slower speeds and possibly, a higher risk of downtime.

Make no mistake though: many websites are more than adequately served with a shared hosting plan.

WordPress users seeking shared hosting would do well with [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/) or [SiteGround](https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/), while those who are more technically oriented would be happy with [A2 Hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/a2-hosting/).

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="VPS hosting with HostGator." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9413" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>VPS hosting with <a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/hostgator/">HostGator</a>.</figcaption></figure>### <span id="VPS_Hosting">VPS Hosting</span>

VPS hosting is a more advanced option where a web host divides a server up using virtualization tools.

VPS hosting is similar to shared hosting in that multiple sites share a physical server, but the **virtualization software maintains hard boundaries** between the resources devoted to one site and resources devoted to others.

VPS hosting is faster than shared hosting and potentially offers better uptime.

However, VPS hosting is also more expensive than shared hosting. Unless your website gets **high-traffic** or you have a resource-intensive website, a VPS plan probably won’t be necessary.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Dedicated hosting plans with InMotion Hosting." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9415" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Dedicated hosting plans</em> with <a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/inmotion/">InMotion Hosting</a>.</figcaption></figure>### <span id="Dedicated_Server">Dedicated Server</span>

A dedicated server is a physical server **dedicated to your website alone**. Everything installed can be used by your site only, and you have full control over the software that is installed onto your server.

Prices for a dedicated server vary, with some options costing not much more than a VPS plan, while others cost hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars per month.

Because dedicated servers are expensive, and because they require a lot of technical competence to set up, configure, and maintain, we don’t recommend one for any but the biggest, busiest websites.

If system administration isn’t your cup of tea, you can opt for managed services where the web host handles most of these tasks on your behalf, but at a higher cost.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Scalable cloud hosting with SiteGround." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9421" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Scalable cloud hosting with <a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/">SiteGround</a></em>.</figcaption></figure>### <span id="Cloud_Hosting">Cloud Hosting</span>

Cloud hosting is where your website isn’t hosted by a single server, but a **cluster of servers** working together as if they were a single server.

This configuration offers you a more robust hosting environment since a single server going offline for whatever reason will likely _not_ affect your website.

Depending on how your web host is set up, your cloud-based data may be distributed in multiple locations around the world.

Cloud hosting is a viable alternative to dedicated hosting since the former offers easily scalable options that can meet increased loads as needed.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Managed WordPress hosting from Bluehost" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9425" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Managed WordPress hosting from <a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/">Bluehost</a></em></figcaption></figure>### <span id="WordPress_Hosting">WordPress Hosting</span>

WordPress is a user-friendly content management system (CMS) that allows people to get up and running with a **blog or website**, even if they’re new to the world of web design and development.

Because WordPress is so commonly used, many hosts offer specialized WordPress plans that include features catering to this demographic, including automatic updates to the WordPress core, free themes and plugins, and so on.

Automattic, the parent company behind WordPress, recommends [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/) as a good option for WordPress users.

## <span id="How_to_Choose_the_Best_Web_Host_for_Your_Needs">How to Choose the Best Web Host for Your Needs</span>

Now that we’ve briefly covered the best web hosts today and types of web hosting available, let’s take a look at the specific features and functionality you’ll want to look for when making your purchase.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="GreenGeeks offers unlimited resources across storage, bandwidth, e-mail accounts, and domains." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9432" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em><a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/greengeeks/">GreenGeeks</a> offers unlimited resources across storage, bandwidth, e-mail accounts, and domains.</em></figcaption></figure>### <span id="Resource_and_Performance_Requirements">Resource and Performance Requirements</span>

Speed matters and this is measured in how long it takes a server to respond to a request. The top hosts have **response speeds** in the range of 250 – 450 milliseconds or so.

Many hosts will offer unlimited bandwidth — a measurement of the traffic that goes to and from the server on your behalf — and unlimited storage with their shared hosting plans.

However, before you purchase, read the fine print. A lot of hosts will throttle your site if you use too many resources so that you don’t negatively impact the performance of other websites that share your server.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Squarespace’s easy-to-use website builder is aimed at beginners." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9428" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em><a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/squarespace/">Squarespace’s</a> easy-to-use</em> <em>website builder is aimed at beginners.</em></figcaption></figure>### <span id="Is_It_User-Friendly_Customizable">Is It User-Friendly? Customizable?</span>

Many web hosting plans come with a **website builder** that will help you get up and running with a website, even if you’ve never written a line of code before.

[Squarespace](https://html.com/web-hosting/squarespace/) is a leader in offering easy-to-use website building tools, but if you are interested in coding your own site, HTML.com can help you [get started](https://html.com/#tutorial).

If you need more features, including support for an e-commerce site, consider Squarespace’s premium offering.

You can also consider a more premium hosting plan from sites like [SiteGround](https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/) or [A2 Hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/a2-hosting/). The biggest downside is that you’ll have to decide on and bring your own e-commerce platform to implement the functionality you need.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="InMotion Hosting’s customer support portal." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9439" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/inmotion/">InMotion Hosting’s</a> customer support portal.</figcaption></figure>### <span id="Quality_of_Customer_Support">Quality of Customer Support</span>

Many hosts offer **24/7 support** reachable via email, telephone, live chat, and/or ticketing center.

Live chat and ticketing predominate in the world of technology because they’re highly efficient means of resolving issues. You can share links (and often screengrabs) via live chat so that the representative can see the issue you’re experiencing.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="SiteGround‘s Live Chat interface is one of the best we’ve seen. At right, you’ll see the photo and name of the in-house tech support rep along with how clients have rated him. Click on the blue button to read a short profile of the rep." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9581" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" /><figcaption><em><a href="https://html.com/go/siteground/">SiteGround</a>‘s Live Chat interface is one of the best we’ve seen. At right, you’ll see the photo and name of the in-house tech support rep along with how clients have rated him. Click on the blue button to read a short profile of the rep.</em></figcaption></figure>#### <span id="Tech_Support_When_You_Need_It">Tech Support When You Need It</span>

Although you might not think you’ll need support at 3 AM, if the hosting for your online store goes down the night before Cyber Monday, you’ll be thankful someone at your hosting company is there to help.

The scope of support varies, but you can typically expect them to help you with things like setup, domain name setup, account management, and other basics related to setting up shop.

#### <span id="Support_Team_In-House_or_Outsourced">Support Team: In-House or Outsourced?</span>

Another factor to consider is whether the support team is in-house. Some businesses (and individuals) prefer an in-house team.

In an era when companies sometimes cut customer support costs (and quality), it pays to find out exactly what kind of support you’ll be getting.

That said we’ve been impressed with the quality of some outsourced live chat support services.

### <span id="Reliability_Infrastructure_Uptime_and_Money-Back_Guarantee">Reliability: Infrastructure, Uptime and Money-Back Guarantee</span>

The point of web hosting is to make sure that **your website is available** to users whenever they want to see it. Uptime is crucial.

#### <span id="What_Is_Uptime">What Is Uptime?</span>

In web hosting, uptime refers to a website being online as opposed to offline. Reasons a site may go offline include routine maintenance performed by the host, natural disasters or severe weather events, and cyber attacks.

A web host’s infrastructure and datacenter are key to making sure that this number is as high as possible.

Uptime is an average, measured as a percentage, spanning a set time interval, such as a month.

For example, if your website had a 99.9% uptime rate for April 2019, that means it was offline for about 24 minutes during that month.

#### <span id="Uptime_Guarantees">Uptime Guarantees</span>

Many hosts offer an uptime guarantee.

This is often spelled out in an “SLA” (Service Level Agreement). The guarantee often includes some form of compensation should the host not meet its guarantee.

Here’s a comparison of our top hosting picks as they relate to uptime and response time.

#### <span id="Our_Testing_Uptime_and_Server_Response_For_Top_Web_Hosts">Our Testing: Uptime and Server Response For Top Web Hosts</span>

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td><td><strong>Uptime</strong><br />
<strong>Average</strong></td><td><strong>Response Time</strong><br />
<strong>Average (ms)</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>A2 Hosting</td><td>99.99%</td><td>815.33</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Bluehost</td><td>99.98%</td><td>398</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>SiteGround</td><td><strong>100.00%</strong></td><td>459.83</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>HostGator</td><td>99.975%</td><td>788.5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>InMotion</td><td>91.83%</td><td>1,379.5</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>GreenGeeks</td><td>99.995%</td><td><strong>310.67</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

_Averages uptime and response time over the last 6 months for our top web hosts._  
_(Squarespace data unavailable)_

As you can see by the bolded numbers above, [SiteGround](https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/) had the best uptime over the last 12 months while [GreenGeeks](https://html.com/web-hosting/a2-hosting/) had the best response time.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Bluehost’s high-performance VPS plans include instant provisioning." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9456" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em><a href="https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/">Bluehost’s</a> high-performance VPS plans include instant provisioning</em>.</figcaption></figure>#### <span id="Money-Back_Guarantees">Money-Back Guarantees</span>

To reassure you on matters of reliability and quality, many hosts offer a money-back guarantee.

That is, if you find that you don’t like what you’ve purchased, you can cancel within the guaranteed period and receive a refund.

Be sure to read the terms of the guarantee to find out exactly what’s covered and what the process is for obtaining a refund.

### <span id="Scalability_and_Flexibility">Scalability and Flexibility</span>

If you have an existing website, you’ll need to **migrate** it from your current host to your new host. This process is, in short, the movement of all data and files related to your website.

#### <span id="Site_Migration">Site Migration</span>

There are many ways to migrate your website, including manually using FTP tools.

Some hosts, like [SiteGround](https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/), offer migration tools and services as bonuses included with your purchase of a web hosting package. Others, like [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/), charge a fee for migration.

#### <span id="Scaling_Up_to_Accommodate_Increasing_Traffic">Scaling Up to Accommodate Increasing Traffic</span>

Sometimes, you’ll find your site traffic growing to the point where you need more resources.

When your website, hosted using a shared plan, is a bit too slow for the traffic levels you see, you might consider springing for a VPS plan.

Video: This Bluehost video highlights how VPS and cloud hosting can easily accommodate the needs of fast-growing personal or small business sites.

Typically your host will inform you when you are close to needing a higher-level plan.

This upgrade might require a migration as well, even if you aren’t changing hosts.

To make sure that you lose as little as possible in the event your site goes down, you should **back up your website** frequently, even daily.

#### <span id="Automated_or_Manual_Backups">Automated or Manual Backups?</span>

Some web hosts will offer tools to help you create backups, while others will offer automated backup services.

If you’re not technically inclined you should choose a host that provides automated backups.

#### <span id="SSL_Certificates_Every_Site_Needs_One">SSL Certificates: Every Site Needs One</span>

You’ll also want to make sure that transmissions to and from your web server are secure, and one of the key aspects of doing so is using **SSL certificates**.

SSL certificates are a must-have as Google now considers them a best practice. Indeed, many browsers will mark your site as “insecure” if you do not have an SSL certificate.

If you have an online store, you’ll want to go a step further and make sure that your solution is **PCI compliant**.

Some hosts, like A2 Hosting, are not PCI compliant but you can use shopping carts, like PayPal and Stripe, that are.

If you’re using a hosted e-commerce builder make sure it’s PCI compliant. Squarespace is an example of a hosted site builder that’s PCI compliant.

## <span id="Summary_8211_What_Makes_Some_Web_Hosts_the_Best">Summary – What Makes Some Web Hosts the Best?</span>

The best web hosts are those that balance things like **performance** and **security** with the **price**.

Because there are always trade-offs, the best host for you depends on your goals. If you’re just getting started, you might prioritize cost and ease-of-use over everything else.

If you’re launching an e-commerce store, you might favor security and speed, even if that costs you a bit more.

How do you spot an undesirable web host? Since no company is going to advertise their limitations, we recommend looking at **reviews written by actual customers** to see how they rate their hosts.

There’s no substitute for actual user experience!

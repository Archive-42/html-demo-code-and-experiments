[GreenGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) is an eco-friendly [web hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/) provider that doesn’t skimp on technology or performance. 

They purchase wind energy credits at a rate of 300% of the energy they consume. And they beat many big name hosts when it comes to server response speeds.

With a variety of hosting plans — including WordPress and Drupal options — domain names, dev tools, and a website builder, this green host is worth checking out. 

What’s their customer support like? Is there a money-back guarantee? How do they test against competitors?  
  
Here are some important things to know before selecting this host.

<span id="What_Is_GreenGeeks">What Is GreenGeeks?</span>
--------------------------------------------------------

As a host, GreenGeeks stands out in several ways:

-   Their dedication to being eco-friendly,
-   Their top-of-the-line technology and infrastructure, and
-   Multiple datacenter locations, many of which take advantage of cooler local temperatures to work more efficiently.

In addition, the company boasts around-the-clock support, a 99.9% uptime guarantee, and a 30-day money back guarantee. If you are looking for a solid, affordable hosting option, GreenGeeks is an appealing option you should consider.  

### Datacenters and Infrastructure

[GreenGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) has datacenters in Chicago, Phoenix, Montreal, and Amsterdam. These locations have a wide geographical spread, which helps customers’ sites load faster.

All datacenters feature a dual-city power grid, battery back up, and onsite diesel generators, which help ensure server uptime. They also provide fire suppression systems and are monitored 24/7.

### What Is Eco-Friendly Hosting?

If being green is important to you or your organization, GreenGeeks should be at the top of your list.

But what exactly is green hosting and does GreenGeeks actually live up to their eco-friendly claims? Or is it just another buzzword thrown around by a host desperate to stand out?

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9725" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>#### Carbon Credits

Green hosting refers to hosting **companies who use renewable energy to directly power their datacenters or purchase carbon credits** to offset their energy usage.

For customers concerned about the environmental impact of hosting, this can be a critical deciding factor.

GreenGeeks stands out among green hosts because **they offset energy usage by 300%** — which means they fund renewable energy at three times the rate they use it.

#### EPA Green Power Partner

According to their website, this makes them the world’s most environmentally responsible hosting company.

They are also recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as an EPA Green Power Partner.

*Video: GreenGeeks explains how their green hosting helps the environment.*

#### Green Tag For Your Website

[GreenGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) customers can share their commitment to being green with site visitors by adding a Green Website Tag to their website.

There are several designs to choose from, so you can choose one that fits your brand image.

Here’s a look at how the shared hosting plans differ.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td><td><strong>Ecosite Starter</strong></td><td><strong>Ecosite Pro</strong></td><td><strong>Ecosite Premium</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Cost / month</td><td><a href="https://html.com/go/greengeeks/">$2.95</a></td><td><a href="https://html.com/go/greengeeks/">$5.95</a></td><td><a href="https://html.com/go/greengeeks/">$11.95</a></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>SSL Certificate</td><td>Let’s Encrypt Wildcard</td><td>Let’s Encrypt Wildcard</td><td>Premium Wildcard</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Speed Performance</td><td>Standard</td><td>2 X</td><td>4 X</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Caching</td><td>none</td><td>PowerCacher</td><td>PowerCacher</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Emails / hour</td><td>100</td><td>300</td><td>500</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>PCI Compliance</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table>

<span id="WordPress_Hosting">WordPress Hosting</span>
-----------------------------------------------------

For those on the WordPress platform, you can opt for a dedicated [WordPress plan](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) instead.

These plans are nearly identical to the shared hosting plans — including price — but it comes pre-configured for WordPress sites, with WordPress pre-installed.

You’ll also get built-in version control, automatic WordPress core updates, and automatic daily backups.

<span id="VPS_Hosting_Plans">VPS Hosting Plans</span>
-----------------------------------------------------

For those who want the benefits of a dedicated server without the cost, VPS (virtual private servers) is a solid option.

Unlike shared plans, where your site may be slowed down if another site has a massive bump in traffic, on a VPS your space on the server is virtually separated from other sites.

In addition to protecting resources, this type of hosting is also more secure.

GreenGeeks offers five different VPS hosting plans that are tiered according to their levels of storage and bandwidth. The lowest tier has

All GreenGeeks VPS hosting plans offer:

-   RAID-10 SSD
-   CSF firewall
-   Built-in PHP/MySQL optimization
-   Free migrations
-   Root Access
-   Seamless upgrade/downgrade services
-   Pre-installed CPanel/WHM

---------------------------------------------------------------

Large sites or those with special security needs may consider using one of GreenGeeks’ [dedicated server plans](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/).

Unlike shared hosting, where you share server resources with dozens of other websites, with a dedicated server your site is the only one hosted on your server.

GreenGeeks offers four different dedicated server plans, based on the storage and specs you need.

-----------------------------------------------

If you’re planning to get into the reseller web hosting business, [GreekGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) has five plans.

All offer unlimited cPanel accounts with datacenters located in the US or Canada, so when deciding which option is best for you, you’ll be comparing differences in SSD storage space and bandwidth maximums.

Regardless of which option you choose, you can:

-   Offer your customers the same perks users of GreekGeek’s shared hosting plans get
-   Brand your hosting products as you see fit
-   Offer free migration services
-   Use GreenGeeks’ web hosting billing system, and much more.

<span id="Customer_Support">Customer Support</span>
---------------------------------------------------

GreenGeeks offers several methods for contacting their support team, including 24/7 live chat support and phone support from Monday – Friday from 9 am to 12 am EST and Saturday and Sunday from 9 am to 8 pm EST.

Many other hosts only offer support during local regular business hours, so the expanded time helps [GreenGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) stand out.

They also offer support through their email ticket system. They report average resolution time for support tickets is 15-20 minutes.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9727" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>### Guarantees

You also get a 99.9% uptime guarantee, and if you’re not satisfied, a full refund if you cancel within 30 days of your purchase.

<span id="GreenGeeks_vs_Bluehost">GreenGeeks vs Bluehost</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, GreenGeeks does offer better hosting features over [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/), such as green hosting, the option to choose your datacenter, and better security features. But, as with all hosts, it truly depends on your needs.

Bluehost is a popular hosting option and there are a few areas where they stand out. For example, Bluehost offers hosting for both Windows and Linux.

Bluehost is also a WordPress recommended host, so if your site is running on WordPress, it may be a better option.

Their shared hosting plans start out at similar price points for the first year, though GreenGeeks’ renewal prices are slightly higher.

For VPS and Dedicated Servers, Bluehost wins on price, though their features vary drastically.

Not sure if GreenGeeks is right for you? Here are two more of our favorite hosts you might want to consider.

### GreenGeeks vs Dreamhost

[DreamHost](https://html.com/web-hosting/dreamhost/) is another carbon-neutral host for customers concerned about their carbon footprint. They also offer specific plans for WordPress and WooCommerce customers.

Price-wise, they are pretty comparable to GreenGeeks, though email is an add-on cost.

### GreenGeeks vs InMotion Hosting

[InMotion Hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/inmotion/) is a US-based hosting provider. While they don’t offer green hosting, they do offer a few developer features GreenGeeks does not like support for PostgreSQL and Ruby on Rails.

(Note: GreenGeeks offers *limited* RoR support on their shared and reseller plans. They advise RoR users to consider VPS or dedicated hosting to get advanced options and full RoR support.)

InMotion also provides fully managed WordPress hosting plans.

<span id="Our_Conclusion">Our Conclusion</span>
-----------------------------------------------

[GreenGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) is a solid, affordable hosting option for most brands and organizations. If reducing your carbon footprint is important, and you don’t want to skimp on performance, GreenGeeks is a good fit for you.

Their 24/7 support and high-tech servers, and fast speeds are a plus no matter how large or how small your site is.

However, if you are highly reliant on your host for help with WordPress, you may be better suited with a more-WordPress specific host. While GreenGeeks can support WordPress, it is not their main focus.

Otherwise, GreenGeeks is well worth looking into. If it seems right for you, visit [GreenGeeks](https://html.com/go/greengeeks/) now.

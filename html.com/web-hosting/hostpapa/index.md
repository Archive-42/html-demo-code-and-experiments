**Pros**

-   Uses renewable energy to power its business
-   WordPress friend
-   Free migration assistance by staff members
-   Plans include access to over 400 free apps
-   Basic security features offered to all

**Cons**

-   Not the cheapest shared hosting plans around
-   Email functionality is not included in all plans, but is available as an add-on
-   No dedicated servers available
-   Shorter-term plans are pricey
-   You could end up playing almost double when you renew your hosting plan after the first term

[HostPapa’s web hosting plans](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) are full-featured, and regardless of which option you choose, you will have what you need to launch your website.

While HostPapa includes many standard offerings in its plans, such as free domain names, there are other things that aren’t included (such as email).

HostPapa isn’t the most expensive hosting option around, but it isn’t the cheapest option, either. However, you do get useful extras, like free business apps and access to a website builder.

Though, if you stick around after the first term, you could get stuck with a much pricier hosting bill.

<span id="About_HostPapa">About HostPapa</span>
-----------------------------------------------

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9529" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>The company offers solid customer service and utilizes renewable green energy to the best of its ability.

HostPapa’s headquarters are located in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. The company operates a single datacenter, though they do not disclose its location.

<span id="Web_Hosting_Options">Web Hosting Options</span>
---------------------------------------------------------

[HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) offers the following types of web hosting:

-   Shared hosting
-   WordPress hosting
-   Online stores
-   Reseller hosting
-   VPS hosting.

### Shared Hosting

Those who are just getting started with a website or are looking for a budget-friendly option will find the shared hosting options appealing.

[HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) offers three different shared hosting plans from which you can choose.

The best option for you depends on the number of websites you need hosted and the size of your websites:

-   **Starter**: supports two websites and includes a free domain name, 100 GB of SSD storage, and unmetered bandwidth
-   **Business**: supports an unlimited number of websites and includes a free domain name and unlimited SSD storage and bandwidth
-   **Business Pro**: identical to the business plan, but includes enhanced performance and security

As you can see, HostPapa’s plans are geared toward small businesses, but the company’s offerings are good options even for personal websites and blogs.

The Business Pro plan, in particular, is useful for those who want better service and a robust hosting plan, yet aren’t ready to splurge on a VPS plan or dedicated server.

Shared hosting customers can also expect a 99.9% uptime, migration assistance, and a 30-minute-long one-on-one call designed to help you get up and running.

#### WordPress Hosting

WordPress users might be interested in HostPapa’s specialized [WordPress hosting plans](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/). These options are very similar to the shared plans:

-   **WP Starter**: supports two websites and includes a free domain name, 100 GB of SSD storage, 100 email accounts, pre-installation of the JetPack optimization suite, and unmetered bandwidth
-   **WP Business**: supports an unlimited number of websites and includes a free domain name and unlimited SSD storage, bandwidth, and email accounts, as well as pre-installation of the JetPack optimization suite
-   **WP Business Pro**: identical to the business plan, but includes enhanced performance and security and installation of the premium version of the JetPack optimization suite

The primary difference, however, between the shared and WordPress plans is that the latter comes with WordPress pre-installed, includes email functionality and other advanced/premium WordPress features.

What’s notable, however, is that there is no increase in pricing for these add-ons.

### Online Stores

HostPapa’s online store hosting option is an all-in-one e-commerce platform.

You get everything you need, including hosting, and you can create your new store’s front-end using the included drag-and-drop store builder.

The online store option also gets you guided setup and management tips, as well as a 30-minute consultation to help you get started.

Pricing for the online store plans (of which there are four) is much higher than for comparable general-use web hosting plans.

But you get everything you need to sell an unlimited number of products without having to pay transaction fees on each sale you make.

### VPS Hosting

[HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) offers a feature-rich VPS hosting option for those who have outgrown their shared hosting plans.

These are managed options that include cPanel control panels, root-level access, and around-the-clock support.

Video: HostPapa provides an overview of its VPS hosting services.

HostPapa offers five different VPS plans from which you can choose, but all are scalable and customizable so you can tweak your plan so that it better fits your website.

### Reseller Hosting

For those looking to start their own web hosting business, HostPapa offers five different reseller hosting plans from which you can choose.

Prices begin at just [$19.95 per month](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/), and you get everything you need to manage an unlimited number of websites, including a single cPanel/WHM control panel, installer for hundreds of apps like WordPress and Joomla, and around-the-clock support in case you ever need help. Visit [HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) now.

<span id="General_HostPapa_Features">General HostPapa Features</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Regardless of which hosting type you opt for, you can expect to get the following when working with HostPapa.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Domains</td><td>Free domain name and registration</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Bandwidth</td><td>Unmetered and unlimited bandwidth</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Performance</td><td>Comes with free Cloudflare CDN integration</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Control panel</td><td>Industry-standard cPanel</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Security</td><td>Free Let’s Encrypt SSL; Sitelock available at an extra cost</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Email accounts</td><td>Not included in entry-level plans; mid-tier hosting plans come with support for 100 email accounts</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Domain Names

You’ll get a [free domain name](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) with the purchase of a hosting plan — even with the most inexpensive shared hosting plan.

### Migration Assistance

If you have an existing website, HostPapa’s team will help you migrate it to your new web server. While many other hosting companies have trended toward providing migration wizards, HostPapa remains one of the few whose staff helps you with this process.

### cPanel Control Panels

HostPapa plans come with the industry-leading cPanel, which provides an easy-to-use interface for things like checking your website’s resource usage, managing your domain names, handling files, and so on. If you opt for a reseller plan, you’ll get access to cPanel’s sister tool, WHM.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="A cPanel demo" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9530" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>A cPanel demo</figcaption></figure>### Unlimited Storage and Bandwidth

Shared hosting plans come with unlimited storage and bandwidth, so you do not have to worry about calculating your usage needs when you get started with HostPapa.

[HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/), like most other companies offering unlimited resource allocations, will throttle a given site’s usage if it exceeds normal parameters (and in some cases, may even take your site offline).

However, most sites would be adequately served by a shared hosting plans.

### Cloudflare CDN

HostPapa has partnered with Cloudflare to offer its customers a free CDN, which provides you with better security and better page performance speeds.

Cloudflare caches and distributes your website across its network of servers, which means that your visitors’ requests are handled by the server that’s closest to them.

This distribution also protects you against failure from any single point of the whole network.

### 99.9% Uptime Guarantee

HostPapa offers its customers a 99.9% uptime guarantee, excluding periods of scheduled maintenance.

### Money-Back Guarantee

Most of HostPapa’s plans come with a 30-day money back guarantee, so if you aren’t satisfied with your purchase, simply cancel your purchase during this period and receive a full refund of all monies paid, less any setup fees or domain name registration and transfer-related costs.

You can cancel at any time by submitting the appropriate support request via your HostPapa Dashboard.

You should note that if you renew your plan after your initial term, you could end up paying double for your hosting plan.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="HostPapa hosting plans renew at regular rates – double the promotional term" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-9518" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>HostPapa hosting plans renew at regular rates – double the promotional term</figcaption></figure>On top of that, the prices advertised are valid for 36-month contracts, the shorter term plans are more expensive. This pricing policy is fairly standard in the hosting industry but something to keep in mind.

### SiteLock Security

If you’re concerned about the security of your website, [HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/) sells SiteLock as an add-on.

SiteLock is a security suite that, depending on the plan you choose, can detect and remove malware, block spam and blacklist spammers, protect against DDoS attacks, and provide firewall protection.

<span id="HostPapa_vs_GoDaddy">HostPapa vs GoDaddy</span>
---------------------------------------------------------

If HostPapa isn’t quite the right fit for you, you might consider [GoDaddy](https://html.com/web-hosting/godaddy/) instead.

Both companies offer budget-friendly web hosting packages that are accessible to users at all levels.

HostPapa and GoDaddy both offer around-the-clock customer service, 99.9% uptime guarantees, and full-featured hosting packages.

[HostPapa](https://html.com/go/hostpapa/), however, is a more limited company in terms of its offerings, while GoDaddy offers pretty much everything under the sun — you can think of GoDaddy as your one-stop-internet shop.

However, for those who are conscious, HostPapa’s commitment to using renewable energy would be appealing.

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td><td><strong>HostPapa</strong></td><td><strong>GoDaddy</strong></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Hosting plans start at…</td><td>$3.95</td><td>$5.99</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Email accounts</td><td>Available as an add-on for starter plans; comes with mid-tier plan plans</td><td>Free for the first year on all plans</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Websites</td><td>Entry-level plan comes with support for two sites</td><td>Entry-level plan comes with support for one site only</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>One-click installs</td><td>Support for 400 applications</td><td>Support for 125 applications</td></tr></tbody></table>

## <span id="Features">Features</span>

[DreamHost](https://html.com/go/dreamhost/) offers a variety of hosting options: Shared Hosting, WordPress Hosting (managed too), Cloud Hosting, Virtual Private Server (VPS), WooCommerce Hosting, and Dedicated Hosting. All of their service plans rely on Linux-based servers.

#### <span id="Shared_Hosting_Features">Shared Hosting Features</span>

- **1 Free domain**
- **50GB** SSD (solid-state drive) storage
- **Unlimited\*** data transfer/bandwidth
- **6** MySQL databases
- **100% uptime** guarantee
- Free SSL certificate via Let’s Encrypt
- Free 24/7 customer support via live chat, and email (phone support at an additional cost)
- Automatic daily server backups
- WordPress comes pre-installed
- Proprietary one-click installer for apps like Drupal and Joomla
- “WP Website Builder” – a drag-and-drop builder to create WordPress websites
- Proprietary user control panel (comparable to cPanel)

_\*As a rule, “unlimited” in the context of shared (or VPS) hosting generally denotes “limitless until you negatively impact server performance, at which point you may be billed or transferred to a more costly service tier.”_

Shared hosting also includes FTP/SFTP/Shell access for a minimum of 6 people. (The Shared Unlimited plan provides for unlimited users.)

DreamHost’s shared plans come with one of the longest money-back guarantee periods in the industry—97 days. And you can add additional features like premium support and enhanced security to your package for a small fee.

#### <span id="Virtual_Private_Server_VPS_Hosting_Features">Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting Features</span>

Have the demands of your site surpassed the capacity of shared hosting? DreamHost’s VPS hosting is a great fit for sites “on the grow” as well as those who need more direct control over their server configuration.

There are 4 tiers of the VPS plan available. The VPS Basic plan offers:

- **1 GB** RAM Memory
- **30 GB** SSD Storage
- **Unlimited** domains
- **Unlimited** monthly bandwidth
- **Unlimited** email accounts for your domain
- Free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate included
- Choice of Apache or Nginx
- Automatic security and software updates
- Optional unique IP (IPv4 or IPv6) for additional fee
- Support for PHP 7, Perl, and Python
- Phusion Passenger, Subversion, Ruby Version Manager, OPCache
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)/SFTP access for your server (unlimited users)

As with shared hosting, these plans offer upgrades for security, support, and dedicated IP addresses. VPS customers can also add an additional low-resource VPS server to their account. (All service upgrades and additional VPS servers carry additional fees.)

For full root access opt for **Dreamhost cloud computing** or a dedicated hosting plan.

#### <span id="WordPress_Hosting">WordPress Hosting</span>

Both managed or unmanaged, DreamHost offers multiple WordPress-optimized hosting packages, too.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-11821" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>These “WordPress on steroids” plans add optimized WordPress servers, expert WordPress support, and robot-assisted WordPress migration.

The three available WordPress plans are:

- Shared WordPress Hosting
- Managed WordPress Hosting
- WooCommerce Hosting

Available features include:

- WordPress comes pre-installed
- All WordPress software updates handled for you
- Automated backups
- Free SSL certificate
- Free email hosting
- 100% uptime guarantee

If you opt for the DreamPress Plus or DreamPress Pro managed plans, phone support is included. DreamPress Pro also includes priority support, described as “immediate” and “hands-on” support.

All WordPress and VPS hosting packages are covered by the company’s 97-day money-back guarantee.

#### <span id="Dedicated_Hosting_Features">Dedicated Hosting Features</span>

A dedicated server offers the ultimate in server control and configuration. [DreamHost](https://html.com/go/dreamhost/) offers nine dedicated plans in three categories: Standard, Enhanced, and Enhanced SSD.

You can get your own physical Ubuntu Linux server, and:

- Processor options ranging from “desktop-grade” to “server-grade”
- **from 4GB to 64 GB of RAM**
- Up to **2 TB** **HDD** or **240 GB SSD** storage
- Total root access for your server

Like the other hosting plans, DreamHost’s dedicated plans can be upgraded with additional domains, more robust support plans, and SSL/dedicated IP options to enhance e-commerce (additional fees apply).

They’re also covered by DreamHost’s 97-day money-back guarantee.

## <span id="Benefits_Breakdown">Benefits Breakdown</span>

Where does DreamHost finish strong and where do they fall short? Let’s wrap it up with the good, the bad, but luckily no ugly.

### <span id="The_Good">The Good</span>

In business since 1997, DreamHost is employee-owned and operated, and while their marketing can be irreverent, it’s clear they’re quite serious about customer satisfaction.

#### <span id="High-Quality_Add-Ons">High-Quality Add-Ons</span>

DreamHost has a nice selection of add-on services, including domain registration, WordPress optimization, cloud-based storage, and cloud-computing services.

These services add value and are ideal for those who need a little more direct support, a little more WordPress wisdom, or a little more power (or even a live testing area) when developing custom applications or e-commerce sites.

### <span id="Comprehensive_Website_Building_Tools">Comprehensive Website Building Tools</span>

DreamHost lays out an impressive selection of website building services like their 2 proprietary website builders (Remixer and the WP Website Builder), and WordPress and WooCommerce plans.

More, DreamHost offers website design services from a team of in-house professionals. Prices start at $249.

### <span id="Pricing_and_Support">Pricing and Support</span>

Pricing levels throughout all plans and services are very competitive, and even though phone support is extra, the 24/7/365 email and live chat support option should prove sufficient for most customers.

The company’s impressive **97-day money-back guarantee** gives unexpected peace of mind for those who might still be finding their way online, and a satisfaction guarantee that grants customers credit for downtime is a nice touch.

### <span id="The_Not-So-Good">The Not-So-Good</span>

While DreamHost offers the full array of standard hosting options, some pretty basic options—such as a dedicated IP address or built-in eCommerce support—are only available a la carte.

#### <span id="No_Popular_Control_Panels_Available">No Popular Control Panels Available</span>

The lack of industry-standard tools like cPanel, Softaculous, and WHM may prove unattractive to those who are accustomed to working in those applications.

However, the “home-grown” custom control panel provided by DreamHost has similar functionality and features, so there may just be a learning curve.

#### <span id="Limited_To_Linux-Only">Limited To Linux-Only</span>

DreamHost is a Linux-only host, so if your site requires support for Windows applications or application development tools like ASP.NET, you’ll need to look elsewhere.

Note: DreamHost’s Cloud Computing page does state that “DreamHost’s cloud servers can be based on Linux, BSD or _even MS Windows_.”

We contacted DreamHost for additional clarification, and they explained: “Windows can be installed as a separate instance in DreamCompute, but is not supported by us.”

For most website owners, DreamHost offers some attractive features at a dreamy price, but keep one eye open for e-commerce, security, and support fees that can add up quickly.

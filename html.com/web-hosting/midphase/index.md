# Midphase Review: Mid End Or High End Hosting?

**Disclosure:** Your support helps keep the site running! We earn a referral fee for some of the services we recommend on this page. [Learn more](https://html.com/disclosure/)

[Midphase](https://html.com/go/midphase/) bills itself as offering affordable Web [hosting](https://html.com/web-hosting/) services. While they do offer a handful of pricey, higher-end options, their self-description is accurate, for the most part. They seem to keep the costs low by limiting the number of features available in their hosting plans, and sticking to the basics, with just a few extras here and there.

<span id="About_OneComnbsp">About One.Com </span>
-------------------------------------------------

> Customer support is available in 14 languages.

[One.com](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) is a web hosting company founded in Denmark in 2002 by Jacob Jensen. It now has locations throughout Europe.

This web hosting provider boasts more than one million customers in 149 countries around the world and has won several product awards over the years from European and American organizations.

Their goal is to provide user-friendly hosting that is simple, effective, and flexible for all users, from beginners to professionals.

One.com is also a green host that uses datacenters powered by clean energy from wind turbines.

<span id="WordPress_Hosting_Options">WordPress Hosting Options</span>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In additional to One.com’s standard shared hosting plans — which we will dig into below — they also offer three WordPress-specific packages.

All three One.com WordPress hosting packages offer 1-click WordPress installation, an SSL certificate, backups, and unlimited website and email accounts.

### Don’t Have a WordPress Website Yet?

The one-click install feature will be particularly useful if you don’t already have a WordPress site. The “one-click” creates an ‘instant’ basic WordPress site for you. Then you’ll customize it by selecting themes and plugins and adding your content.

Here is a quick rundown of the specific features of each WordPress hosting plan.  

> WordPress plans comes with an SSL certificate and unlimited bandwidth.

### Plus WordPress 

-   200 GB SSD (solid-state drive) Storage
-   2 GB RAM
-   Supports multiple websites (though you must purchase any additional domain names) 
-   Unlimited databases
-   SSH, FTP/SFTP access
-   Backup and Restore features 
-   A staging environment so you can test before sending features live 
-   Performance cache

### Business WordPress

-   500 GB SSD Storage 
-   4 GB RAM 
-   Multiple website hosting (additional domain names must be purchased) 
-   SSH, FTP/SFTP access 
-   Backup and Restore 
-   Staging environment 
-   Performance cache 
-   SiteLock Find malware scanner 

### Premium WordPress 

-   500 GB SSD Storage 
-   4 GB RAM 
-   Hosting for multiple sites (with domain purchase) 
-   SSH, FTP/SFTP access 
-   Backup and Restore 
-   Staging environment 
-   Performance cache
-   SiteLock Find malware scanner 
-   Search Engine Optimizer 

These [WordPress plans](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) are slight upgrades to their traditional hosting packages. Overall, they aren’t among the most feature-rich plans in the industry, but they are super affordable. For small sites without lots of traffic, One.com’s WordPress plans are a solid option. 

<span id="Onecom8217s_Shared_Web_Hosting_Plans">One.com’s Shared Web Hosting Plans</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> One.com offers a 15-day, money-back guarantee.

Keep in mind, [One.com](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) only provides *shared hosting*, so remember to research all the plan’s features thoroughly before you create your hosting account to make sure you’ll get everything you need.

Once you sign up, your upgrade options are pretty limited.

One.com offers two shared hosting plans, the **Starter Plan** and their **Professional Plus** plan. (They do also provide e-commerce hosting plans, which we will cover later.) 

### Starter Plan

One.com says their Starter plan is ideal for smaller sites, such as basic websites, blogs, or customers who just need email hosting. 

> Shared hosting plans come with SSD (solid-state drive) storage. SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs (hard disk drives).

With their Starter Hosting plan, you get:

-   Linux-based shared hosting
-   One.com’s proprietary control panel
-   1 free domain registration
-   Hosting for 1 website
-   50 GB SSD (solid-state drive) storage
-   512 MB RAM
-   1 database
-   SSL certificate
-   PHP & FTP/SFTP access 
-   Unlimited emails 
-   Unlimited bandwidth

One.com’s prices are super cheap: their starter plan starts at a very affordable price of just [$2.45 per month](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/). 

### Professional Plus Hosting 

> Both of One.com’s shared hosting plans come with backup and restore functions.

The next step up from One.com’s starter plan is called Professional Plus. They say this is the best plan for mature sites who need high-end performance. Keep in mind, this is still shared hosting, so it isn’t ideal for very large sites. 

The Professional Plus plan gives you everything in the Starter plan, plus: 

-   Support for hosting **multiple sites** on one account (though you must purchase additional domain names) 
-   **Unlimited databases** (vs single database)
-   **200 GB SSD** (solid state drive) storage 
-   **2 GB RAM **
-   **SSH access** 

<span id="Hosting_Plan_Features">Hosting Plan Features</span>
-------------------------------------------------------------

> The “free” domain that comes with your web hosting plan is free for the first year only.

All of [One.com’s](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) hosting packages include:

-   Website builder (no coding necessary)
-   One-click WordPress installation
-   Unlimited email accounts
-   Unlimited transfer
-   Domain registration

### Does One.com Use cPanel?

One.com does not provide cPanel – which is a popular brand of control panel used by many hosts. Instead if provides its own custom control panel which is easy to use but does not include the variety of features available via cPanel.

<span id="DIY_Website_Buildernbspnbsp">DIY Website Builder  </span>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

One.com offers a website builder that requires no coding knowledge. Instead, you use professionally designed templates to create a mobile- optimized site. 

### Professionally Designed Templates

They offer a wide range of [template selections](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) with clean, modern design. These include templates for wedding sites, events, restaurants, musicians, freelancers, and businesses.

There are some layouts targeting creatives like marketing agencies, photographers, and artists.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-11078" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

### Drag-and-Drop Ease

One.com’s website builder also allows you to drag-and-drop components, so you aren’t stuck with just what the template offers. The interface is clean, with well-labeled tools and the ability to add coding if you choose to do so. 

The website builder comes free with all shared hosting plans, except WordPress plans (which come with 1-click WordPress installation.)

*This One.com promotional video provides a quick overview of the drag-and-drop website builder.*

<span id="Getting_Started_in_E-Commerce_With_the_Online_Store_Creator">Getting Started in E-Commerce With the Online Store Creator</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> WordPress users can always opt to use open source WooCommerce, which is free.

One.com also offers an online [store creator](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/), designed to help all websites (including WordPress users!) to start selling in just a few minutes. While the site builder is a free feature for hosting customers, the online shop creator is not. 

Pricing for One.com’s online store creators ranges between [$12 and $14](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/), depending on whether you use WordPress (which is more expensive.) 

Features include: 

-   Responsive mobile design 
-   Unlimited pages 
-   Premium templates 
-   SSL certificate
-   Fully featured online store
-   Ability to accept credit card payments 
-   Free images 

The WordPress plan offers additional features, including more storage, 1-click WordPress installation, and backup and restore features. 

<span id="Domain_Namesnbsp">Domain Names </span>
------------------------------------------------

All plans come with one free domain name. However, you will have to purchase additional names if you want to host multiple websites on some of the larger hosting packages. 

Customers can choose from more than 250 domain name extensions, including **.com, .info, .dk, .digital, and .academy**. Pricing starts around $10 and goes up for a few of the more unique extensions. 

### Domain Pricing and Discounts

Their domain pricing is somewhat high for the first year, because they don’t offer a huge discount like some brands. But the renewal rates are on par with what other brands charge. 

#### Late Renewal Fees

Keep an eye on your domain name, though. You can renew it up to 5 days after expiration without incurring penalty fees. If you miss the 5-day window you’ve got another 25 days to renew it, but you’ll pay a “redemption” fee on top of the renewal price. The redemption fees range between **$25 and $80**, depending on the extension. 

This contrasts with [GoDaddy](https://html.com/web-hosting/godaddyweb/) — another bargain-priced host — which gives you an 18-day grace period. During this 18-day period you can renew your expired domain without being charged a “redemption” fee.

<span id="Customer_Supportnbsp">Customer Support </span>
--------------------------------------------------------

One.com offers [24/7 customer support](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) in many languages. In fact, you can choose to view their website in one of 14 languages.

### Chat Support and Email Support

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-11092" width="373" height="415" /></figure>

Chat support is standard in the web hosting industry and it’s available from One.com. They also provide an email address for email support.

They also provide a fairly extensive knowledgebase filled with FAQs and “Top 5 Guides.” 

 We were able to quickly find the answers to most questions through their search function. 

Since One.com is not designed for large, high-performance sites, the lack of live phone support doesn’t seem like a major drawback. However, some of our user reviewers have complained about customer service. 

### Does One.com Provide an Uptime Guarantee?

One.com does not provide an uptime guarantee. (An uptime guarantee provides some type of compensation should your site go offline.) However, most web hosts have an uptime above 99%. Uptime guarantees tend to be more important for heavily trafficked e-commerce sites or sites that rely on advertising revenue.

### Does One.com Have a Money-Back Guarantee?

Yes, One.com has a money-back guarantee. You can get a full refund by requesting it within 15 days of placing your One.com corder. Email their support team to receive a refund. Be sure to request a “refund” not a “cancellation.” (The two are handled differently.)

Note: you can only use this full money-back feature once. If you request a *second refund*, domain registration costs will not be included, but the “web space” and setup fee will be.

We recommend that you familiarize yourself with your chosen [web host](https://html.com/web-hosting/)’s policy before signing up.

<span id="Onecom_vs_GoDaddy_Which_Host_Should_You_Choosenbsp">One.com vs GoDaddy: Which Host Should You Choose? </span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As one of the most well-known affordable hosting brands, [GoDaddy](https://html.com/web-hosting/godaddyweb/) is a likely second choice for customers looking for a cheap, shared hosting solution. But which is the best choice for you? Well, it all depends on what your needs are. 

There are a few areas where GoDaddy stands out: They offer a 30-day money back guarantee, versus One.com’s 15-day money back offer.

GoDaddy also offers a broader range of hosting plans, such as dedicated hosting and VPS. If you are building a site that may grow, you might consider GoDaddy for its options to upgrade. 

GoDaddy also offers 24/7 support by phone, email, or tickets, while One.com only provides support through chat. 

Customers who may need to upgrade to a bigger hosting plan in the future or who prefer phone support should consider using GoDaddy. 

<span id="Who_Is_Onecom_Best_For">Who Is One.com Best For?</span>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[One.com](https://html.com/go/one-com-hosting/) may be best for those with simple hosting needs, low traffic, and a small budget. Their pricing is exceptionally low, but they don’t offer many advanced features.

Those who want bargain prices with more features and services should explore [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/), [GoDaddy](https://html.com/web-hosting/godaddyweb/), or [1&1 IONOS](https://html.com/web-hosting/1-and-1/).

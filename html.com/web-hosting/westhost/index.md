-----------------------------------

WestHost offers four levels of hosting: Shared, Cloud-based Virtual Private Server (VPS), Reseller, and Dedicated (Reseller and VPS hosting are both supported by the same cloud-based servers). All of their service plans rely on Linux-based servers.

#### <span id="Virtual_Private_Server_VPS_Hosting_Features">Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting Features</span>

If you need greater control over your Web server, or you’ve simply outgrown shared hosting, WestHost’s **three VPS plans** may be the answer. These plans (Burst, Storm, and Monsoon) add dedicated CPUs and other enhancements to the basic shared hosting options.

-   -   -   Your own virtual Linux server, with:
            -   **Full** root access to your server for application installation/customization
            -   Dedicated CPU, running at up to **5.4 GHz**
            -   Up to **3384 MB** of dedicated RAM
            -   Up to **90 GB** of storage space
            -   Up to **2250 GB** monthly bandwidth
            -   **Unlimited\*** email accounts with webmail and POP3 (1,000 accounts with Burst plan)
        -   Pro-active, 24/7/365 managed support
        -   Dedicated IP address
        -   File Transfer Protocol (FTP) access for your server
        -   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate (requires dedicated IP; additional fees apply)
        -   Managed hosting is available (including consultation and server optimization) for an additional fee
        -   **Blesta** billing application
        -   Free **cPanel** license
        -   **Softaculous** one-click installer

*\*As a rule, “unlimited” in the context of shared hosting generally denotes “limitless until you negatively impact server performance, at which point you may be billed or transferred to a more costly service tier.”*

WestHost’s **reseller plans** are also hosted in this tier. They are **identical in pric**e and basic features, but include **free SSL certificates, cPanel** and **WHM**, a **reseller account**, and **extra dedicated IP addresses** (up to 8) to support reseller and eCommerce functions.

Both VPS and reseller hosting are covered by WestHost’s **60-day money-back guarantee**, and can also be upgraded with additional resources and services for a fee.

#### <span id="Dedicated_Hosting_Features">Dedicated Hosting Features</span>

If it’s total Web server control and security you’re after, one of WestHost’s four dedicated hosting plans might just fit the bill.

-   -   -   Your own physical Linux server, with:
            -   All of the features and perks of the lower tiers
            -   **Free initial setup**
            -   Total root access for your server
            -   **Four** dedicated IP addresses
            -   Single or dual **Intel® processors** (ATOM™ or Xeon™)
            -   Up to **24 GB** of RAM
            -   Up to **1 TB** of storage space, with a choice of software or hardware RAID
            -   Up to **10 TB** of monthly traffic
            -   Both **unmanaged** and **fully managed** hosting and support plans are available
            -   **cPanel, WHMCS, Softaculous** and other applications are included
            -   **Four** free SSL certificates included
            -   Nightly backups available (additional fees apply)
            -   **RAID configurations available** (additional fees apply)

WestHost covers its dedicated hosting plans with the same **60-day money-back guarantee** that covers all its plans. All of the services included in the managed hosting plans are available for purchase a la carte for those who choose unmanaged plans, although the price difference is small enough to make managed hosting a more attractive option for anyone disinclined to “tinker” with their Web server.

<span id="Benefits_Breakdown">Benefits Breakdown</span>
-------------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="The_Good">The Good</span>

Positioning themselves as **a value, rather than a bargain,** WestHost offers cutting-edge data centers, full-service support and a rich feature set available for plans at every level, striking an attractive balance between affordability and power.

A **60-day money-back guarantee** is a welcome upgrade to the 30-day industry standard, and perks like **fully managed hosting** and backup upgrades provide additional peace of mind for an additional fee each month.

#### <span id="The_Not-So-Good">The Not-So-Good</span>

While prices at the shared level are not only affordable, but compare very favorably with similar competitors’ pricing (particularly when one considers the inclusion of applications like cPanel and Softaculous without an additional monthly fee), customers investigating both unmanaged and managed dedicated hosting options might be a bit taken aback by the **relatively restrictive** storage and RAM options.

As a **Linux-only** provider, WestHost is not for you f your site requires support for Windows applications, or you’re using application development tools like ASP.NET.

WestHost seeks to set itself apart from its competition with true value and outstanding customer support, and for the most part, it succeeds in that mission. But for high-end plans, premium service and next-gen hardware are counteracted somewhat by a Linux-only environment and **relatively modest limits** on resources like RAM and storage, so those with high-traffic or resource-hungry sites may want to take a close look at what’s on offer before choosing a plan.

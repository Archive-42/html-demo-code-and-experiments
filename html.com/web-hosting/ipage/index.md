<span id="About_iPage">About iPage</span>
-----------------------------------------

iPage was originally founded in 1998 by Thomas Gorny.

### <span id="Who_Is_iPage_Owned_By">Who Is iPage Owned By?</span>

It’s currently owned by Endurance International Group (EIG), the parent company behind well-known internet brands like [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/), [HostGator](https://html.com/web-hosting/hostgator/) and [FatCow](https://html.com/web-hosting/fatcow/).

Since its founding, iPage has developed a reputation for offering full-featured hosting plans at low prices.

The company has two datacenters that serve over 1 million websites. iPage is based in Burlington, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston.

<span id="iPage_Hosting">iPage Hosting</span>
---------------------------------------------

> For those with decision fatigue, iPage offers a single shared hosting plan for $1.99 per month.

[iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) offers the three basic levels of hosting: Shared (called “iPage Essential” by iPage), Virtual Private Server (VPS), and Dedicated. The company uses Linux-based servers for all three tiers, and its plans use the “unlimited everything” model.

All plans come with $200 total in Bing and Google Ads credits, a common perk offered by web hosts.

### <span id="Shared_Hosting_Plans">Shared Hosting Plans</span>

For those who are getting started or are seeking web hosting for a smaller website or blog, iPage’s shared hosting plan should be sufficient.

#### One Price for Shared Hosting

There’s only one option available to you, and those who have decision fatigue when considering other web hosting companies will find this one-size-fits-all option to be a breath of fresh air.

And it is just [$1.99 per month](https://html.com/go/ipage/) with the introductory price ($7.99 on renewal).

The iPage Essential plan comes with:

-   **Free** domain for one year
-   **Unlimited** domains and sub-domains
-   **Unlimited disk space** and storage
-   **Unmetered** data transfer/bandwidth
-   **Unmetered** MySQL databases
-   **Unmetered** email addresses and webmail (IMAP and POP3)
-   Free 24/7 US-based customer support via Web/phone/email
-   User-generated backups (via utility)
-   Daily server backups
-   A free template-based website builder (up to six pages)
-   Free shared SSL certificate
-   Web hosting control panel (vDeck).

The shared hosting tier also includes a complimentary Yellowpages.com listing and an “anytime” money-back guarantee. You also have access to **a la carte add-ons** for **e-commerce, scripting, website management**, as well as **marketing services** (additional fees may apply).

#### Does iPage Use cPanel?

[iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) doesn’t come standard with cPanel Control Panel; rather the company builds a custom control panel for its customers. The base product is the **vDeck control panel**, but it has been modified by iPage so that the final product is easier for customers to use.

iPage customers may opt to use the cPanel only if they purchase a VPS hosting plan or a dedicated server.

#### WordPress Hosting

Those who have built their websites using WordPress might be interested in the [WordPress hosting](https://html.com/go/ipage/) — a special kind of shared hosting.

There are two different plans from which you can choose: WP Starter and WP Essential.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="iPage WordPress plans" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-8754" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /><figcaption>iPage WordPress plans</figcaption></figure>Regardless of which WordPress hosting plan you choose, you will get:

-   A free domain name
-   **Unmetered** storage
-   **Unmetered** bandwidth
-   Use of a customized control panel
-   Pre-installed themes and plugins.

If, however, you opt for the more expensive WP Essential option, you’ll also get technical support from WordPress experts, automatic malware removal, and use of the SiteLock professional security toolset.

If this sounds good, visit [iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) now.

### <span id="VPS_Hosting_Plans">VPS Hosting Plans</span>

Do you need more precise control over your server or more power to support your high-traffic or e-commerce site? iPage offers three different VPS plans from which you can choose: “Basic,” “Business,” and “Optimum.”

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="iPage VPS plans" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-8760" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /><figcaption>iPage VPS plans</figcaption></figure>-   The same standard features available in shared plans

### <span id="Dedicated_Hosting_Plans">Dedicated Hosting Plans</span>

If you’re looking for iron-clad security, want total control over your hardware and software, or have a website that’s growing by leaps and bounds, then iPage’s dedicated hosting plans are worth a look.

There are three of them: Startup, Professional, and Enterprise.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="iPage Dedicated plans" class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-8758" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /><figcaption>iPage Dedicated plans</figcaption></figure>-   All of the basic features of the lower tiers

-   Total root access for your server
-   **Free** enhanced cPanel/WHM license
-   **Managed hosting**, customizable to meet your needs.

iPage’s dedicated hosting plans are covered by the company’s **anytime money-back guarantee.**

<span id="Website_Builder">Website Builder</span>
-------------------------------------------------

> The basic website builder comes included with the purchase of a web hosting plan.

If you don’t already have a website and you’re in the market for a tool that will help you craft a professional front-end, iPage offers [Website Builder plans](https://html.com/go/ipage/).

For those who want a bit more from their website builder, [iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) offers two higher-tiered plans for [$6.99](https://html.com/go/ipage/) (Professional) and [$15.99](https://html.com/go/ipage/) (Business) per month when you purchase a 3-year contract.

<span id="Domain_Names">Domain Names</span>
-------------------------------------------

iPage is a domain name registrar, so you can purchase domain names from the company.

### <span id="Can_I_Change_My_Domain_Name">Can I Change My Domain Name?</span>

If you purchase web hosting services, you can transfer an existing domain that you already own, or you can register a new domain name.

<span id="Customer_Support">Customer Support</span>
---------------------------------------------------

[iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) provides 24/7 live chat support. You can also request assistance via an online form or by phone.

There’s an online knowledgebase with [tutorials](https://html.com/) on things like setting up FTP access and how to use the free advertising credits you receive from iPage.

Plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

<span id="Server_Response_Times_Improved_Speed">Server Response Times: Improved Speed</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our testing of iPage server response times shows a significant improvement after October 2018. That month showed a sluggish average monthly response time of 2,181 ms (milliseconds).

Compare that to November of 2018 which showed an average 446 ms response time. Uptime was 99.8%.

<figure><img src="http://html.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" alt="Data from November 2018 showing a now-typical average response time of 446 ms." class="lazy lazy-hidden wp-image-8808" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /><figcaption>Data from November 2018 showing a now-typical average response time of 446 ms.</figcaption></figure><span id="iPage_Pros_and_Cons">iPage Pros and Cons</span>
---------------------------------------------------------

**Pros**

-   All-inclusive hosting plans
-   Low prices
-   Green hosting
-   US-based tech support
-   Good documentation

**Cons**

-   No cPanel on shared hosting
-   Linux-only hosting
-   Limited programming languages

### <span id="Pros">Pros</span>

[iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) seeks to bring a little bit of everything to the hosting experience while keeping prices not only competitive but extremely affordable at the introductory levels.

The various **wizards** offered at the shared level can help even the most resistant Luddite set up a professional and effective website with ease, and the **step-by-step tutorials** add an extra dimension of support on top of the ’round-the-clock support services found on all tiers.

### <span id="Cons">Cons</span>

In seeking to create an attractive collage of hosting services at affordable prices, iPage is forced to leave out a few you might expect to find as standard components of your plan, particularly at the shared hosting level.

These include, but aren’t limited to:

-   **cPanel support:** shared and WordPress hosting plans use the company’s proprietary site-based control panel instead of cPanel (the industry-leading and most commonly-used option).
-   A **stand-alone application installer**: many applications and scripts normally supplied as a part of Fantastico or Softaculous either incur additional fees to install, are replaced by “wizards,” or are missing altogether). This also means that it is slightly more work for you to install add-on applications for use with your website.
-   **Developer tools**: support for applications like **PHP, Perl** and **Ruby on Rails** is limited in the entry-level shared and WordPress hosting plans (however, support for these applications is included with VPS and dedicated hosting).

Also, because [iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) is a **Linux-only** hosting provider, it may not be the right solution for you if your site requires support for Windows applications, or you plan to add or develop applications that require ASP.NET or other Windows-based languages.

<span id="iPage_vs_HostGator">iPage vs HostGator</span>
-------------------------------------------------------

If [iPage](https://html.com/go/ipage/) isn’t quite the right fit for you, consider its sister company, [HostGator](https://html.com/web-hosting/hostgator/).

Both iPage and [HostGator](https://html.com/web-hosting/hostgator/) offer a variety of hosting options, but neither offer a dizzying area of choices the way some of its competitors do.

Both offer entry-level shared hosting at budget-friendly prices, as well as more expensive, premium hosting options like VPS and dedicated options.

Some of the primary differences between iPage and HostGator, however, are that the latter offers its users **more choices** and flexibility. There are multiple hosting plans from which you can choose, even at the shared hosting level. Furthermore, HostGator offers **cPanel** access, along with one-click installers for popular add-ons to websites.

### <span id="SiteGround_Bluehost_and_Squarespace">SiteGround, Bluehost and Squarespace</span>

With that said, HostGator isn’t the only good alternative to iPage. Other options you might consider include SiteGround, Bluehost, and Squarespace.

[SiteGround](https://html.com/web-hosting/siteground/) is known for offering great customer service, [Bluehost](https://html.com/web-hosting/bluehost/) is known for its partnership with WordPress, and [Squarespace](https://html.com/web-hosting/squarespace/) is known for its best-in-class website building tools and professional-looking templates.

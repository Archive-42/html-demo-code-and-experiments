<h2 id="protips">ProTips:</h2>
<p>One of the key jobs of validating a pull request is running a series of tests to check that it won’t break any existing work when merging in, and that the work that is does add actually… works. We can check this using a CI service like <a href="https://travis-ci.org/getting_started">Travis</a>. It allows people to know without having to wait for a team member to see if they have made any functional error in their code.</p>

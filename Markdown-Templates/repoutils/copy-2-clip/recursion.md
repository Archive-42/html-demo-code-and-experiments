Improving Your Profile Using GitHub
===================================

By now you are likely familiar with certain aspects of GitHub. You know how to create repos and add and commit code, but there is much, much more that GitHub can do.

GitHub is an online community of software engineers - a place where we not only house our code, but share ideas, express feedback, gain inspiration, and present ourselves as competent, qualified software engineers. Yes, this is a place to manage version control and collaborate on projects, but in this module we are going to discuss how to harness the power of GitHub to your advantage.

Aside from your actual code repositories, there are several other sections that represent who you are as a developer.

-   **Followers and Following**: Think of this as your "friends' list on GitHub.

    If you see a social media profile of a person with two friends, what are you going to think? Though you're not expected to have hundreds of followers on GitHub, you should follow your peers and encourage them to follow you to show industry engineers that there are people who would vouch for your skillset.

-   **Stars**: These are the “likes” on your GitHub profile. Similar to

    encouraging others to follow you and following them, you should also “star” their popular repositories. By the end of the curriculum, you should have several stars on each of your portfolio projects.

-   **Green Gardens**: This is birds-eye view of your “newsfeed” if your newsfeed

    reflected the number of commits that you were making. If you are very active on GitHub, your activity squares, AKA “green gardens” will be verdant and green. This tells anyone who views your profile that you are actively coding and engaged with your identity as a software engineer. However, if your “green gardens” are not green, this suggests that you are not actively coding and therefore perhaps not the best candidates for a development job.

-   **Photo and brief intro**: This is fairly straight-forward and should mirror

    the photo from you LinkedIn. Choose a professional photo and brief description that highlights the fact that you are a software engineer.

Your followers, stars, green gardens, and photo represent who you are as a developer and should be constantly monitored and updated. It can be easy to fall into the trap of not pushing commits to GitHub or keeping your commits on your local machine - be careful to avoid these tendencies because they are counter-productive to your candidacy as a software engineer.

Not only is GitHub as representation of you as a developer, but it is also a place to present proposals, recaps, and provide additional project context. Two features that you will soon become familiar with are Wikis and READMEs.

Wikis (pre-project)
-------------------

Wikis are features of PUBLIC repositories on GitHub and are where your design documents, explanation of technologies used and insight into what your repo contains will live.

Wikis are created at the beginning of any significant project and should be updated as your project evolves.

To create or update your repository's Wiki, click on the “Wiki” tab in your repo header and click “Edit” to update your home page and “New Page” to add a new section.

![Wiki tab on GitHub](images/github-repo-menu-bar-wiki.png)

Best practices for Wiki creation:

-   List of technologies in a visually accessible place
-   Separate design documents into their own sections
-   Write clearly and concisely - grammar and spelling matters!

Design documents will become very important when you begin your projects, but for now just know that you will spend time creating a solid Wiki in order to facilitate a smooth development process. One of the most important aspects of your Wiki will be the outline of your project's features and the **minimum viable product** (MVP).

As you begin any project, you will consider what constitutes a “final product” and break down features into bite-sized “minimum viable products.” For example, if you intend to create an a/A version of Twitter, your list of MVPs may include:

-   Users are able to log into application
-   Users are able to create, edit, and delete tweets
-   Users are able to follow other users and see their tweets
-   Users are able to like other users tweets
-   Users are able to comment on other users tweets

In order for your project to stay on track, it is very important to break down your features and tackle one MVP at a time. All of the MVPs combined result in a final application.

Your MVP breakdown will live in your project's Wiki and is subject to evolution. As your project comes to life, your MVPs may merge, divide, or become irrelevant. Update your Wiki as things change and continue to referring to it as your go through the development process.

README files (post-project)
---------------------------

READMEs are text files that introduce and explain a project. Typically, READMEs are created and completed when you are ready to roll your application into production. READMEs should contain information about two impressive features that you implemented in your project, the technologies used, how to install the program, and anything else that makes you stand out as a software developer.

Think of READMEs as the “first impression” that prospective employers, colleagues, and peers will have of you as a developer. You want their first impression to be “wow, this person is thorough and this project sounds interesting,” not “oh no, typos, missing instructions, and snores-galore.”

When it is time to create your README, you should allocate about three hours to guarantee you have enough time to make your project shine.

README.md files are written using markdown syntax (.md) which makes them appear nicely on-screen. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's a very simple language used to create beautiful and presentable README and Wiki files for GitHub. There are many good resources out there for creating markdown documents, but here are two of our favorite:

-   GitHub's guide to [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
-   [Repository with a collection of examples](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)
-   [Browser side-by-side markdown and on-screen program](https://stackedit.io/app#) (this is a favorite, code

    here and copy markdown into GitHub).

README Best Practices

-   Divide your README into distinct sections
-   List the technologies used at the top of your README for increased visibility
-   Include nice pictures or Gifs to show and/or demonstrate how things work
-   Include code snippets
-   Provide instructions for how to install project (if applicable)
-   Include link to the live site

Wrap up
-------

The bottom line is that the way you represent yourself on GitHub matters! Take the time you need to write clearly, accurately reflect your process and applications, and immerse yourself in the diverse and interesting pool of software professionals who work and play on GitHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your GitHub Identity
====================

It is hard to write about yourself. But, today, you need to do that. This is a day of starting to establish how other software developers and hiring managers will perceive you.

Go to your GitHub profile page. Edit your profile to contain your description, “App Academy (<span class="lang-js citation" data-cites="appacademy">@appacademy</span>)” as your current company, your location (if you desire), and your Web site.

Now, make a personal Web site for your GitHub profile. You can do that using GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions at [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) to create your site, add a theme, create a custom 404, and use HTTPS (if you want).

Spend time writing about yourself. Like you read earlier, this is hard. But, tell the story of you in a way that will engage people.

Now, go follow all of your class mates and star their personal Web site repository, if they created one.

If you want to get really fancy and set up a blog, you can use a “static site generator” known as **Jekyll** to do that. It's a Ruby-based program; however, you don't need to know Ruby to use it. All you have to be able to do is use command line programs, something you're really getting to be a pro at! To do this, follow the well-documented instructions at [Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

Big-O By Colt Steele
====================

Colt Steele provides a very nice, non-mathy introduction to Big-O notation. Please watch this so you can get the easy introduction. Big-O is, by its very nature, math based. It's good to get an understanding before jumping in to math expressions.

[Complete Beginner's Guide to Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kS_gr2_-ws8) by Colt Steele.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation
==============================================

As software engineers, our goal is not just to solve problems. Rather, our goal is to solve problems efficiently and elegantly. Not all solutions are made equal! In this section we'll explore how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their speed (*time complexity*) and memory consumption (*space complexity*).

> In this article, we'll use the word *efficiency* to describe the amount of resources a program needs to execute. The two resources we are concerned with are *time* and *space*. Our goal is to *minimize* the amount of time and space that our programs use.

When you finish this article you will be able to:

-   explain why computer scientists use Big-O notation
-   simplify a mathematical function into Big-O notation

Why Big-O?
----------

Let's begin by understanding what method we should *not* use when describing the efficiency of our algorithms. Most importantly, we'll want to avoid using absolute units of time when describing speed. When the software engineer exclaims, “My function runs in 0.2 seconds, it's so fast!!!”, the computer scientist is not impressed. Skeptical, the computer scientist asks the following questions:

1.  What computer did you run it on? \_Maybe the credit belongs to the hardware

    and not the software. Some hardware architectures will be better for certain operations than others.\_

2.  Were there other background processes running on the computer that could have

    effected the runtime? *It's hard to control the environment during performance experiments.*

3.  Will your code still be performant if we increase the size of the input? \_For

    example, sorting 3 numbers is trivial; but how about a million numbers?\_

The job of the software engineer is to focus on the software detail and not necessarily the hardware it will run on. Because we can't answer points 1 and 2 with total certainty, we'll want to avoid using concrete units like “milliseconds” or “seconds” when describing the efficiency of our algorithms. Instead, we'll opt for a more abstract approach that focuses on point 3. This means that we should focus on how the performance of our algorithm is affected by increasing the size of the input. **In other words, how does our performance scale?**

> The argument above focuses on *time*, but a similar argument could also be made for *space*. For example, we should not analyze our code in terms of the amount of absolute kilobytes of memory it uses, because this is dependent on the programming language.

Big-O Notation
--------------

In Computer Science, we use Big-O notation as a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input argument(s). We use mathematical functions in Big-O notation, so there are a few big picture ideas that we'll want to keep in mind:

1.  The function should be defined in terms of the size of the input(s).
2.  A *smaller* Big-O function is more desirable than a larger one. Intuitively,

    we want our algorithms to use a minimal amount of time and space.

3.  Big-O describes the worst-case scenario for our code, also known as the

    upper bound. We prepare our algorithm for the worst case, because the best case is a luxury that is not guaranteed.

4.  A Big-O function should be simplified to show only its most dominant

    mathematical term.

The first 3 points are conceptual, so they are easy to swallow. However, point 4 is typically the biggest source of confusion when learning the notation. Before we apply Big-O to our code, we'll need to first understand the underlying math and simplification process.

### Simplifying Math Terms

We want our Big-O notation to describe the performance of our algorithm with respect to the input size and nothing else. Because of this, we should to simplify our Big-O functions using the following rules:

-   **Simplify Products:** if the function is a product of many terms, we drop the

    terms that *don't* depend on the size of the input.

-   **Simplify Sums:** if the function is a sum of many terms, we keep the term

    with the *largest* growth rate and drop the other terms.

We'll look at these rules in action, but first we'll define a few things:

-   **n** is the size of the input
-   **T(f)** refers to an unsimplified mathematical **f**unction
-   **O(f)** refers to the Big-O simplified mathematical **f**unction

### Simplifying a Product

If a function consists of a product of many factors, we drop the factors that don't depend on the size of the input, n. The factors that we drop are called constant factors because their size remains consistent as we increase the size of the input. The reasoning behind this simplification is that we make the input large enough, the non-constant factors will overshadow the constant ones. Below are some examples:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Unsimplified</th><th>Big-O Simplified</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>T( 5 * n<sup>2</sup> )</td><td>O( n<sup>2</sup> )</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T( 100000 * n )</td><td>O( n )</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T( n / 12 )</td><td>O( n )</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T( 42 * n * log(n) )</td><td>O( n * log(n) )</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T( 12 )</td><td>O( 1 )</td></tr></tbody></table>

Note that in the third example, we can simplify `T( n / 12 )` to `O( n )`

because we can rewrite a division into an equivalent multiplication. In other words, `T( n / 12 ) = T( 1/12 * n         ) = O( n )` .

### Simplifying a Sum

If the function consists of a sum of many terms, we only need to show the term that grows the fastest, relative to the size of the input. The reasoning behind this simplification is that if we make the input large enough, the fastest growing term will overshadow the other, smaller terms. To understand which term to keep, you'll need to recall the relative size of our common math terms from the previous section. Below are some examples:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Unsimplified</th><th>Big-O Simplified</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>T( n<sup>3</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + n )</td><td>O( n<sup>3</sup> )</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T( log(n) + 2<sup>n</sup> )</td><td>O( 2<sup>n</sup> )</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T( n + log(n) )</td><td>O( n )</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T( n! + 10<sup>n</sup> )</td><td>O( n! )</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Putting it all together

The *product* and *sum* rules are all we'll need to Big-O simplify any math functions. We just apply the *product rule* to drop all constants, then apply the *sum rule* to select the single most dominant term.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Unsimplified</th><th>Big-O Simplified</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>T( 5n<sup>2</sup> + 99n )</td><td>O( n<sup>2</sup> )</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>T( 2n + nlog(n) )</td><td>O( nlog(n) )</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>T( 2<sup>n</sup> + 5n<sup>1000</sup>)</td><td>O( 2<sup>n</sup> )</td></tr></tbody></table>

> Aside: We'll often omit the multiplication symbol in expressions as a form of shorthand. For example, we'll write *O( 5n<sup>2</sup> )* in place of *O( 5 \* n<sup>2</sup> )*.

What you've learned
-------------------

In this reading we:

-   explained why Big-O is the preferred notation used to describe the efficiency

    of algorithms

-   used the product and sum rules to simplify mathematical functions into Big-O

    notation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common Complexity Classes
=========================

Analyzing the efficiency of our code seems like a daunting task because there are many different possibilities in how we may choose to implement something. Luckily, most code we write can be categorized into one of a handful of common complexity classes. In this reading, we'll identify the common classes and explore some of the code characteristics that will lead to these classes.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

-   name *and* order the seven common complexity classes
-   identify the time complexity class of a given code snippet

The seven major classes
-----------------------

There are seven complexity classes that we will encounter most often. Below is a list of each complexity class as well as its Big-O notation. This list is ordered from *smallest to largest*. Bear in mind that a “more efficient” algorithm is one with a smaller complexity class, because it requires fewer resources.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Big-O</th><th>Complexity Class Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>O(1)</td><td>constant</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>O(log(n))</td><td>logarithmic</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>O(n)</td><td>linear</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>O(n * log(n))</td><td>loglinear, linearithmic, quasilinear</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>O(n<sup>c</sup>) - O(n<sup>2</sup>), O(n<sup>3</sup>), etc.</td><td>polynomial</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>O(c<sup>n</sup>) - O(2<sup>n</sup>), O(3<sup>n</sup>), etc.</td><td>exponential</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>O(n!)</td><td>factorial</td></tr></tbody></table>

There are more complexity classes that exist, but these are most common. Let's take a closer look at each of these classes to gain some intuition on what behavior their functions define. We'll explore famous algorithms that correspond to these classes further in the course.

For simplicity, we'll provide small, generic code examples that illustrate the complexity, although they may not solve a practical problem.

### O(1) - Constant

Constant complexity means that the algorithm takes roughly the same number of steps for any size input. In a constant time algorithm, there is no relationship between the size of the input and the number of steps required. For example, this means performing the algorithm on a input of size 1 takes the same number of steps as performing it on an input of size 128.

#### Constant growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a constant function. Notice that the behavior stays *constant* for all values of n.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(1)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>128</td><td>~1</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Example Constant code

Below is are two examples of functions that have constant runtimes.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(1)
    function constant1(n) {
     return n * 2 + 1;
    }

    // O(1)
    function constant2(n) {
     for (let i
        = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
     console.log(i);
     }
    }

The runtime of the `constant1` function does not depend on the size of the input, because only two arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) are always performed. The runtime of the `constant2` function also does not depend on the size of the input because one-hundred iterations are always performed, irrespective of the input.

### O(log(n)) - Logarithmic

Typically, the hidden base of O(log(n)) is 2, meaning O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)). Logarithmic complexity algorithms will usual display a sense of continually “halving” the size of the input. Another tell of a logarithmic algorithm is that we don't have to access every element of the input. O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)) means that every time we double the size of the input, we only require one additional step. Overall, this means that a large increase of input size will increase the number of steps required by a small amount.

#### Logarithmic growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a logarithmic runtime function. Notice that doubling the input size will only require only one additional “step”.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(log<sub>2</sub>(n))</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>2</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>~2</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>8</td><td>~3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>16</td><td>~4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>128</td><td>~7</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Example logarithmic code

Below is an example of two functions with logarithmic runtimes.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(log(n))
    function logarithmic1(n) {
     if (n <= 1) return;
     logarithmic1(n / 2);
    }

    // O(log(n))
    function logarithmic2(n) {
     let i =
        n;
     while (i > 1) {
     i /= 2;
     }
    }

The `logarithmic1` function has O(log(n)) runtime because the recursion will half the argument, n, each time. In other words, if we pass 8 as the original argument, then the recursive chain would be 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1. In a similar way, the `logarithmic2` function has O(log(n)) runtime because of the number of iterations in the while loop. The while loop depends on the variable `i` , which will be divided in half each iteration.

### O(n) - Linear

Linear complexity algorithms will access each item of the input “once” (in the Big-O sense). Algorithms that iterate through the input without nested loops or recurse by reducing the size of the input by “one” each time are typically linear.

#### Linear growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a linear runtime function. Notice that a change in input size leads to similar change in the number of steps.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(n)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~2</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>~4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>128</td><td>~128</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Example linear code

Below are examples of three functions that each have linear runtime.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(n)
    function linear1(n) {
     for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     console.log(i);
     }
    }

    // O(n), where n is the length of the
            array
    function linear2(array) {
     for (let i
        = 0; i < array.length; i++)
        {
     console.log(i);
     }
    }

    // O(n)
    function linear3(n) {
     if (n ===
        1) return;
     linear3(n - 1);
    }

The `linear1` function has O(n) runtime because the for loop will iterate n times. The `linear2` function has O(n) runtime because the for loop iterates through the array argument. The `linear3` function has O(n) runtime because each subsequent call in the recursion will decrease the argument by one. In other words, if we pass 8 as the original argument to `linear3` , the recursive chain would be 8 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 5 -&gt; … -&gt; 1.

### O(n \* log(n)) - Loglinear

This class is a combination of both linear and logarithmic behavior, so features from both classes are evident. Algorithms the exhibit this behavior use both recursion and iteration. Typically, this means that the recursive calls will halve the input each time (logarithmic), but iterations are also performed on the input (linear).

#### Loglinear growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a loglinear runtime function.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(n * log<sub>2</sub>(n))</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>2</td><td>~2</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>~8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>8</td><td>~24</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>128</td><td>~896</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Example loglinear code

Below is an example of a function with a loglinear runtime.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(n * log(n))
    function loglinear(n) {
     if (n <= 1) return;

     for (let i
        = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     console.log(i);
     }

     loglinear(n / 2);
     loglinear(n / 2);
    }

The `loglinear` function has O(n \* log(n)) runtime because the for loop iterates linearly (n) through the input and the recursive chain behaves logarithmically (log(n)).

### O(n<sup>c</sup>) - Polynomial

Polynomial complexity refers to complexity of the form O(n<sup>c</sup>) where `n` is the size of the input and `c` is some fixed constant. For example, O(n<sup>3</sup>) is a larger/worse function than O(n<sup>2</sup>), but they belong to the same complexity class. Nested loops are usually the indicator of this complexity class.

#### Polynomial growth

Below are tables showing the growth for O(n<sup>2</sup>) and O(n<sup>3</sup>).

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~9</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>128</td><td>~16, 384</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~27</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>128</td><td>~2, 097, 152</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Example polynomial code

Below are examples of two functions with polynomial runtimes.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(n^2)
    function quadratic(n) {
     for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {}
     }
    }

    // O(n^3)
    function cubic(n) {
     for (let i
        = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     for (let j
        = 1; j <= n; j++) {
     for (let k
        = 1; k <= n; k++) {}
     }
     }
    }

The `quadratic` function has O(n<sup>2</sup>) runtime because there are nested loops. The outer loop iterates n times and the inner loop iterates n times. This leads to n \* n total number of iterations. In a similar way, the `cubic`

function has O(n<sup>3</sup>) runtime because it has triply nested loops that lead to a total of n \* n \* n iterations.

### O(c<sup>n</sup>) - Exponential

Exponential complexity refers to Big-O functions of the form O(c<sup>n</sup>) where `n` is the size of the input and `c` is some fixed constant. For example, O(3<sup>n</sup>) is a larger/worse function than O(2<sup>n</sup>), but they both belong to the exponential complexity class. A common indicator of this complexity class is recursive code where there is a constant number of recursive calls in each stack frame. The `c` will be the number of recursive calls made in each stack frame. Algorithms with this complexity are considered quite slow.

#### Exponential growth

Below are tables showing the growth for O(2<sup>n</sup>) and O(3<sup>n</sup>). Notice how these grow large, quickly.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(2<sup>n</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~2</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>~16</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>128</td><td>~3.4028 * 10<sup>38</sup></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(3<sup>n</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~9</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~27</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>3</td><td>~81</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>128</td><td>~1.1790 * 10<sup>61</sup></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Exponential code example

Below are examples of two functions with exponential runtimes.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(2^n)
    function exponential2n(n) {
     if (n === 1) return;
     exponential_2n(n - 1);
     exponential_2n(n - 1);
    }

    // O(3^n)
    function exponential3n(n) {
     if (n ===
        0) return;
     exponential_3n(n - 1);
     exponential_3n(n - 1);
     exponential_3n(n - 1);
    }

The `exponential2n` function has O(2<sup>n</sup>) runtime because each call will make two more recursive calls. The `exponential3n` function has O(3<sup>n</sup>) runtime because each call will make three more recursive calls.

### O(n!) - Factorial

Recall that `n! = (n) * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1` . This complexity is typically the largest/worst that we will end up implementing. An indicator of this complexity class is recursive code that has a variable number of recursive calls in each stack frame. Note that *factorial* is worse than *exponential* because *factorial* algorithms have a *variable* amount of recursive calls in each stack frame, whereas *exponential* algorithms have a *constant* amount of recursive calls in each frame.

#### Factorial growth

Below is a table showing the growth for O(n!). Notice how this has a more aggressive growth than exponential behavior.

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>n</th><th>O(n!)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>~1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>~2</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>~6</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>~24</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>128</td><td>~3.8562 * 10<sup>215</sup></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Factorial code example

Below is an example of a function with factorial runtime.

    code class="language-javascript"// O(n!)
    function factorial(n) {
     if (n === 1) return;

     for (let i
        = 1; i <= n; i++) {
     factorial(n - 1);
     }
    }

The `factorial` function has O(n!) runtime because the code is *recursive* but the number of recursive calls made in a single stack frame depends on the input. This contrasts with an *exponential* function because exponential functions have a *fixed* number of calls in each stack frame.

You may it difficult to identify the complexity class of a given code snippet, especially if the code falls into the loglinear, exponential, or factorial classes. In the upcoming videos, we'll explain the analysis of these functions in greater detail. For now, you should focus on the *relative order* of these seven complexity classes!

What you've learned
-------------------

In this reading, we listed the seven common complexity classes and saw some example code for each. In order of ascending growth, the seven classes are:

1.  Constant
2.  Logarithmic
3.  Linear
4.  Loglinear
5.  Polynomial
6.  Exponential
7.  Factorial

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memoization
===========

**Memoization** is a design pattern used to reduce the overall number of calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive strategies to solve.

Recall that recursion solves a large problem by dividing it into smaller sub-problems that are more manageable. Memoization will store the results of the sub-problems in some other data structure, meaning that you avoid duplicate calculations and only “solve” each subproblem once. There are two features that comprise memoization:

-   the function is recursive
-   the additional data structure used is typically an object (we refer to this as

    the memo!)

This is a trade-off between the time it takes to run an algorithm (without memoization) and the memory used to run the algorithm (with memoization). Usually memoization is a good trade-off when dealing with large data or calculations.

You cannot always apply this technique to recursive problems. The problem must have an “overlapping subproblem structure” for memoization to be effective.

Here's an example of a problem that has such a structure:

> Using pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, what is the smallest combination of coins that total 27 cents?

You'll explore this exact problem in depth later on. For now, here is some food for thought. Along the way to calculating the smallest coin combination of 27 cents, you should also calculate the smallest coin combination of say, 25 cents as a component of that problem. This is the essence of an overlapping subproblem structure.

Memoizing factorial
-------------------

Here's an example of a function that computes the factorial of the number passed into it.

    code class="language-javascript"function factorial(n) {
        if (n === 1) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    factorial(6); // => 720, requires 6
            calls
    factorial(6); // => 720, requires 6
            calls
    factorial(5); // => 120, requires 5
            calls
    factorial(7); // => 5040, requires 7
            calls

From this plain `factorial` above, it is clear that every time you call `factorial(6)` you should get the same result of `720` each time. The code is somewhat inefficient because you must go down the full recursive stack for each top level call to `factorial(6)` . It would be great if you could store the result of `factorial(6)` the first time you calculate it, then on subsequent calls to `factorial(6)` you simply fetch the stored result in constant time. You can accomplish exactly this by memoizing with an object!

    code class="language-javascript"let memo = {}

    function factorial(n) {
     // if this function has calculated factorial(n)
            previously,
     // fetch the stored result in memo
     if (n in
        memo) return memo[n];
     if (n ===
        1) return 1;

     // otherwise, it havs not calculated factorial(n)
            previously,
     // so calculate it now, but store the result in
            case it
            is
     // needed again in the future
     memo[n] = n * factorial(n - 1);
     return memo[n]
    }

    factorial(6); // => 720, requires 6
            calls
    factorial(6); // => 720, requires 1
            call
    factorial(5); // => 120, requires 1
            call
    factorial(7); // => 5040, requires 2
            calls

    memo; // => {
            '2': 2,
            '3': 6, '4': 24, '5': 120, '6': 720, '7': 5040 }

The `memo` object above will map an argument of `factorial` to its return value. That is, the keys will be arguments and their values will be the corresponding results returned. By using the memo, you are able to avoid duplicate recursive calls!

Here's some food for thought: By the time your first call to `factorial(6)`

returns, you will not have just the argument `6` stored in the memo. Rather, you will have *all* arguments 2 to 6 stored in the memo.

Hopefully you sense the efficiency you can get by memoizing your functions, but maybe you are not convinced by the last example for two reasons:

-   You didn't improve the speed of the algorithm by an order of Big-O (it is

    still O(n)).

-   The code uses some global variable, so it's kind of ugly.

Both of those points are true, so take a look at a more advanced example that benefits from memoization.

Memoizing the Fibonacci generator
---------------------------------

Here's a *naive* implementation of a function that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input.

    code class="language-javascript"function fib(n) {
        if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }

    fib(6); // => 8

Before you optimize this, ask yourself what complexity class it falls into in the first place.

The time complexity of this function is not super intuitive to describe because the code branches twice recursively. Fret not! You'll find it useful to visualize the calls needed to do this with a tree. When reasoning about the time complexity for recursive functions, draw a tree that helps you see the calls. Every node of the tree represents a call of the recursion:

![fib\_tree](images/fib_tree.png)

In general, the height of this tree will be `n` . You derive this by following the path going straight down the left side of the tree. You can also see that each internal node leads to two more nodes. Overall, this means that the tree will have roughly 2<sup>n</sup> nodes which is the same as saying that the `fib`

function has an exponential time complexity of 2<sup>n</sup>. That is very slow! See for yourself, try running `fib(50)` - you'll be waiting for quite a while (it took 3 minutes on the author's machine).

Okay. So the `fib` function is slow. Is there anyway to speed it up? Take a look at the tree above. Can you find any repetitive regions of the tree?

![fib\_tree\_duplicates](images/fib_tree_duplicates.png)

As the `n` grows bigger, the number of duplicate sub-trees grows exponentially. Luckily you can fix this using memoization by using a similar object strategy as before. You can use some JavaScript default arguments to clean things up:

    code class="language-javascript"function fastFib(n, memo = {}) {
        if (n in memo) return memo[n];
        if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;

     memo[n] = fastFib(n - 1, memo) + fastFib(n - 2,
        memo);
     return memo[n];
    }

    fastFib(6); // => 8
    fastFib(50); // =>
            12586269025

The code above can calculate the 50th Fibonacci number almost instantly! Thanks to the `memo` object, you only need to explore a subtree fully once. Visually, the `fastFib` recursion has this structure:

![fib\_memoized](images/fib_memoized.png)

You can see the marked nodes (function calls) that access the memo in green. It's easy to see that this version of the Fibonacci generator will do far less computations as `n` grows larger! In fact, this memoization has brought the time complexity down to linear `O(n)` time because the tree only branches on the left side. This is an enormous gain if you recall the complexity class hierarchy.

The memoization formula
-----------------------

Now that you understand memoization, when should you apply it? Memoization is useful when attacking recursive problems that have many overlapping sub-problems. You'll find it most useful to draw out the visual tree first. If you notice duplicate sub-trees, time to memoize. Here are the hard and fast rules you can use to memoize a slow function:

1.  Write the unoptimized, brute force recursion and make sure it works.
2.  Add the memo object as an additional argument to the function. The keys will

    represent unique arguments to the function, and their values will represent the results for those arguments.

3.  Add a base case condition to the function that returns the stored value if

    the function's argument is in the memo.

4.  Before you return the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a

    value and make the function's argument it's key.

What you learned
----------------

You learned a secret to possibly changing an algorithm of one complexity class to a lower complexity class by using memory to store intermediate results. This is a powerful technique to use to make sure your programs that must do recursive calculations can benefit from running much faster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tabulation
==========

Now that you are familiar with *memoization*, you can explore a related method of algorithmic optimization: **Tabulation**. There are two main features that comprise the Tabulation strategy:

-   the function is iterative and *not* recursive
-   the additional data structure used is typically an array, commonly referred to

    as the table

Many problems that can be solved with memoization can also be solved with tabulation as long as you convert the recursion to iteration. The first example is the canonical example of recursion, calculating the Fibonacci number for an input. However, in the example, you'll see the iteration version of it for a fresh start!

Tabulating the Fibonacci number
-------------------------------

Tabulation is all about creating a table (array) and filling it out with elements. In general, you will complete the table by filling entries from “left to right”. This means that the first entry of the table (first element of the array) will correspond to the smallest subproblem. Naturally, the final entry of the table (last element of the array) will correspond to the largest problem, which is also the final answer.

Here's a way to use tabulation to store the intermediary calculations so that later calculations can refer back to the table.

    code class="language-javascript"function tabulatedFib(n) {
        // create a blank array with n reserved spots
        let table = new Array(n);

     // seed the first two values
     table[0] =
        0;
     table[1] =
        1;

     // complete the table by moving from left to
            right,
     // following the fibonacci pattern
     for (let
        i = 2; i <= n; i += 1) {
     table[i] = table[i -
        1] + table[i - 2];
     }

     return table[n];
    }

    console.log(tabulatedFib(7)); // =>
            13

When you initialized the table and seeded the first two values, it looked like this:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>i</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code class="language-javascript">table[i]</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">0</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">1</code></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

After the loop finishes, the final table will be:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>i</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code class="language-javascript">table[i]</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">0</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">1</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">1</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">2</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">3</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">5</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">8</code></td><td><code class="language-javascript">13</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Similar to the previous `memo` , by the time the function completes, the `table`

will contain the final solution as well as all sub-solutions calculated along the way.

To compute the complexity class of this `tabulatedFib` is very straightforward since the code is iterative. The dominant operation in the function is the loop used to fill out the entire table. The length of the table is roughly `n`

elements long, so the algorithm will have an *O(n)* runtime. The space taken by our algorithm is also *O(n)* due to the size of the table. Overall, this should be a satisfying solution for the efficiency of the algorithm.

Aside: Refactoring for O(1) Space
---------------------------------

You may notice that you can cut down on the space used by the function. At any point of the loop, the calculation really only need the previous two subproblems' results. There is little utility to storing the full array. This refactor is easy to do by using two variables:

    code class="language-javascript"function fib(n) {
     let mostRecentCalcs =
        [0, 1];

     if (n ===
        0) return mostRecentCalcs[0];

     for (let i
        = 2; i <= n; i++) {
     const [secondLast, last]
        = mostRecentCalcs;
     mostRecentCalcs = [last,
        secondLast + last];
     }

     return mostRecentCalcs[1];
    }

Bam! You now have O(n) runtime and O(1) space. This is the most optimal algorithm for calculating a Fibonacci number. Note that this strategy is a pared down form of tabulation, since it uses only the last two values.

### The Tabulation Formula

Here are the general guidelines for implementing the tabulation strategy. This is just a general recipe, so adjust for taste depending on your problem:

1.  Create the table array based off of the size of the input, which isn't always

    straightforward if you have multiple input values

2.  Initialize some values in the table that “answer” the trivially small

    subproblem usually by initializing the first entry (or entries) of the table

3.  Iterate through the array and fill in remaining entries, using previous

    entries in the table to perform the current calculation

4.  Your final answer is (usually) the last entry in the table

What you learned
----------------

You learned another way of possibly changing an algorithm of one complexity class to a lower complexity class by using memory to store intermediate results. This is a powerful technique to use to make sure your programs that must do iterative calculations can benefit from running much faster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis of Linear Search
=========================

Consider the following search algorithm known as **linear search**.

    code class="language-javascript"function search(array, term) {
     for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
        {
     if (array[i] == term) {
     return i;
     }
     }
     return -1;
    }

Most Big-O analysis is done on the “worst-case scenario” and provides an upper bound. In the worst case analysis, you calculate the upper bound on running time of an algorithm. You must know the case that causes the maximum number of operations to be executed.

For *linear search*, the worst case happens when the element to be searched ( `term` in the above code) is not present in the array. When `term` is not present, the `search` function compares it with all the elements of `array` one by one. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of linear search would be O(n).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis of Binary Search
=========================

Consider the following search algorithm known as the **binary search**. This kind of search only works if the array is already sorted.

    code class="language-javascript"function binarySearch(arr, x, start, end) {
     if (start > end) return false;

     let mid =
        Math.floor((start + end) /
        2);
     if (arr[mid] === x) return true;

     if (arr[mid] > x) {
     return binarySearch(arr, x,
        start, mid - 1);
     } else
        {
     return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
     }
    }

For the *binary search*, you cut the search space in half every time. This means that it reduces the number of searches you must do by half, every time. That means the number of steps it takes to get to the desired item (if it exists in the array), in the worst case takes the same amount of steps for every number within a range defined by the powers of 2.

-   7 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   9 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   15 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   17 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   31 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   32 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1
-   33 -&gt; 17 -&gt; 9 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1

So, for any number of items in the sorted array between 2<sup>n-1</sup> and 2<sup>n</sup>, it takes *n* number of steps. That means if you have *k* items in the array, then it will take *log*<sub>*2*</sub>*k*.

Binary searches are *O*(*log*<sub>*2*</sub>*n*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis of the Merge Sort
==========================

Consider the following divide-and-conquer sort method known as the **merge sort**.

    code class="language-javascript"function merge(leftArray, rightArray) {
     const sorted = [];
     while (leftArray.length > 0 && rightArray.length > 0) {
     const leftItem =
        leftArray[0];
     const rightItem =
        rightArray[0];

     if (leftItem >
        rightItem) {
     sorted.push(rightItem);
     rightArray.shift();
     } else
        {
     sorted.push(leftItem);
     leftArray.shift();
     }
     }

     while (leftArray.length !== 0) {
     const value = leftArray.shift();
     sorted.push(value);
     }

     while (rightArray.length !== 0) {
     const value = rightArray.shift();
     sorted.push(value);
     }

     return sorted
    }

    function mergeSort(array) {
     const length = array.length;
     if (length == 1) {
     return array;
     }

     const middleIndex = Math.ceil(length / 2);
     const leftArray = array.slice(0,
        middleIndex);
     const rightArray = array.slice(middleIndex, length);

     leftArray = mergeSort(leftArray);
     rightArray = mergeSort(rightArray);

     return merge(leftArray, rightArray);
    }

For the *merge sort*, you cut the sort space in half every time. In each of those halves, you have to loop through the number of items in the array. That means that, for the worst case, you get that same *log*<sub>*2*</sub>*n* but it must be multiplied by the number of elements in the array, *n*.

Merge sorts are *O*(*n\*log*<sub>*2*</sub>*n*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analysis of Bubble Sort
=======================

Consider the following sort algorithm known as the **bubble sort**.

    code class="language-javascript"function bubbleSort(items) {
     var length = items.length;
     for (var i = 0; i <
        length; i++) {
     for (var j = 0; j < (length
        - i - 1); j++) {
     if (items[j] > items[j
        + 1]) {
     var tmp = items[j];
     items[j] = items[j + 1];
     items[j + 1] = tmp;
     }
     }
     }
    }

For the *bubble sort*, the worst case is the same as the best case because it always makes nested loops. So, the outer loop loops the number of times of the items in the array. For each one of those loops, the inner loop loops again a number of times for the items in the array. So, if there are *n* values in the array, then a loop inside a loop is *n* \* *n*. So, this is O(n<sup>2</sup>). That's polynomial, which ain't that good.

Bubble Sort
===========

Bubble Sort is generally the first major sorting algorithm to come up in most introductory programming courses. Learning about this algorithm is useful educationally, as it provides a good introduction to the challenges you face when tasked with converting unsorted data into sorted data, such as conducting logical comparisons, making swaps while iterating, and making optimizations. It's also quite simple to implement, and can be done quickly.

Bubble Sort is *almost never* a good choice in production. simply because:

-   It is not efficient
-   It is not commonly used
-   There is a stigma attached to using it

*“But…then…why are we…”*
------------------------

It is *quite useful* as an educational base for you, and as a conversational base for you while interviewing, because you can discuss how other more elegant and efficient algorithms improve upon it. Taking naive code and improving upon it by weighing the technical tradeoffs of your other options is 100% the name of the game when trying to level yourself up from a junior engineer to a senior engineer.

The algorithm bubbles up
------------------------

As you progress through the algorithms and data structures of this course, you'll eventually notice that there are some recurring funny terms. “Bubbling up” is one of those terms.

When someone writes that an item in a collection “bubbles up,” you should infer that:

-   The item is *in motion*
-   The item is moving *in some direction*
-   The item *has some final resting destination*

When invoking Bubble Sort to sort an array of integers in ascending order, the largest integers will “bubble up” to the “top” (the end) of the array, one at a time.

The largest values are captured, put into motion in the direction defined by the desired sort (ascending right now), and traverse the array until they arrive at their end destination. See if you can observe this behavior in the following animation (courtesy http://visualgo.net):

![bubble sort](images/BubbleSort.gif)

As the algorithm iterates through the array, it compares each element to the element's right neighbor. If the current element is larger than its neighbor, the algorithm swaps them. This continues until all elements in the array are sorted.

How does a pass of Bubble Sort work?
------------------------------------

Bubble sort works by performing multiple *passes* to move elements closer to their final positions. A single pass will iterate through the entire array once.

A pass works by scanning the array from left to right, two elements at a time, and checking if they are ordered correctly. To be ordered correctly the first element must be less than or equal to the second. If the two elements are not ordered properly, then we swap them to correct their order. Afterwards, it scans the next two numbers and continue repeat this process until we have gone through the entire array.

See one pass of bubble sort on the array `[2, 8, 5, 2, 6]` . On each step the elements currently being scanned are in **bold**.

-   \[**2**, **8**, 5, 2, 6\] - ordered, so leave them alone
-   \[2, **8**, **5**, 2, 6\] - not ordered, so swap
-   \[2, 5, **8**, **2**, 6\] - not ordered, so swap
-   \[2, 5, 2, **8**, **6**\] - not ordered, so swap
-   \[2, 5, 2, 6, 8\] - the first pass is complete

Because at least one swap occurred, the algorithm knows that it wasn't sorted. It needs to make another pass. It starts over again at the first entry and goes to the next-to-last entry doing the comparisons, again. It only needs to go to the next-to-last entry because the previous “bubbling” put the largest entry in the last position.

-   \[**2**, **5**, 2, 6, 8\] - ordered, so leave them alone
-   \[2, **5**, **2**, 6, 8\] - not ordered, so swap
-   \[2, 2, **5**, **6**, 8\] - ordered, so leave them alone
-   \[2, 2, 5, 6, 8\] - the second pass is complete

Because at least one swap occurred, the algorithm knows that it wasn't sorted. Now, it can bubble from the first position to the last-2 position because the last two values are sorted.

-   \[**2**, **2**, 5, 6, 8\] - ordered, so leave them alone
-   \[2, **2**, **5**, 6, 8\] - ordered, so leave them alone
-   \[2, 2, 5, 6, 8\] - the third pass is complete

No swap occurred, so the Bubble Sort stops.

Ending the Bubble Sort
----------------------

During Bubble Sort, you can tell if the array is in sorted order by checking if a swap was made during the previous pass performed. If a swap was not performed during the previous pass, then the array must be totally sorted and the algorithm can stop.

You're probably wondering why that makes sense. Recall that a pass of Bubble Sort checks if any adjacent elements are **out of order** and swaps them if they are. If we don't make any swaps during a pass, then everything must be already **in order**, so our job is done. Let that marinate for a bit.

Pseudocode for Bubble Sort
--------------------------

`Bubble Sort: (array)   n := length(array)   repeat   swapped = false   for i := 1 to n - 1 inclusive do        /* if this pair is out of order */       if array[i - 1] > array[i] then          /* swap them and remember something changed */         swap(array, i - 1, i)         swapped := true        end if     end for   until not swapped`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selection Sort
==============

Selection Sort is very similar to Bubble Sort. The major difference between the two is that Bubble Sort bubbles the *largest* elements up to the end of the array, while Selection Sort selects the *smallest* elements of the array and directly places them at the beginning of the array in sorted position. Selection sort will utilize swapping just as bubble sort did. Let's carefully break this sorting algorithm down.

The algorithm: select the next smallest
---------------------------------------

Selection sort works by maintaining a sorted region on the left side of the input array; this sorted region will grow by one element with every “pass” of the algorithm. A single “pass” of selection sort will select the next smallest element of unsorted region of the array and move it to the sorted region. Because a single pass of selection sort will move an element of the unsorted region into the sorted region, this means a single pass will shrink the unsorted region by 1 element whilst increasing the sorted region by 1 element. Selection sort is complete when the sorted region spans the entire array and the unsorted region is empty!

![selection sort](images/SelectionSort.gif)

The algorithm can be summarized as the following:

1.  Set MIN to location 0
2.  Search the minimum element in the list
3.  Swap with value at location MIN
4.  Increment MIN to point to next element
5.  Repeat until list is sorted

The pseudocode
--------------

In pseudocode, the Selection Sort can be written as this.

`procedure selection sort    list  : array of items    n     : size of list     for i = 1 to n - 1    /* set current element as minimum*/       min = i        /* check the element to be minimum */        for j = i+1 to n          if list[j] < list[min] then             min = j;          end if       end for        /* swap the minimum element with the current element*/       if indexMin != i  then          swap list[min] and list[i]       end if    end for end procedure`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insertion Sort
==============

With Bubble Sort and Selection Sort now in your tool box, you're starting to get some experience points under your belt! Time to learn one more “naive” sorting algorithm before you get to the efficient sorting algorithms.

The algorithm: insert into the sorted region
--------------------------------------------

Insertion Sort is similar to Selection Sort in that it gradually builds up a larger and larger sorted region at the left-most end of the array.

However, Insertion Sort differs from Selection Sort because this algorithm does not focus on searching for the right element to place (the next smallest in our Selection Sort) on each pass through the array. Instead, it focuses on sorting each element in the order they appear from left to right, regardless of their value, and inserting them in the most appropriate position in the sorted region.

See if you can observe the behavior described above in the following animation:

![insertion sort](images/InsertionSort.gif)

The Steps
---------

Insertion Sort grows a sorted array on the left side of the input array by:

1.  If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;
2.  Pick next element
3.  Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list
4.  Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the

    value to be sorted

5.  Insert the value
6.  Repeat until list is sorted

These steps are easy to confuse with selection sort, so you'll want to watch the video lecture and drawing that accompanies this reading as always!

The pseudocode
--------------

`procedure insertionSort( A : array of items )    int holePosition    int valueToInsert     for i = 1 to length(A) inclusive do:        /* select value to be inserted */       valueToInsert = A[i]       holePosition = i        /*locate hole position for the element to be inserted */        while holePosition > 0 and A[holePosition-1] > valueToInsert do:          A[holePosition] = A[holePosition-1]          holePosition = holePosition -1       end while        /* insert the number at hole position */       A[holePosition] = valueToInsert     end for  end procedure`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merge Sort
==========

You've explored a few sorting algorithms already, all of them being quite slow with a runtime of O(n<sup>2</sup>). It's time to level up and learn your first time-efficient sorting algorithm! You'll explore **merge sort** in detail soon, but first, you should jot down some key ideas for now. The following points are not steps to an algorithm yet; rather, they are ideas that will motivate how you can derive this algorithm.

-   it is easy to merge elements of two sorted arrays into a single sorted array
-   you can consider an array containing only a single element as already

    trivially sorted

-   you can also consider an empty array as trivially sorted

The algorithm: divide and conquer
---------------------------------

You're going to need a helper function that solves the first major point from above. How might you merge two sorted arrays? In other words you want a `merge`

function that will behave like so:

    code class="language-javascript"let arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 15];
    let arr2 = [0, 2, 3, 7, 10];
    merge(arr1, arr2); // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 10, 15]

Once you have that, you get to the “divide and conquer” bit.

The algorithm for merge sort is actually *really* simple.

1.  if there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted. return that

    array.

2.  otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more

    be divided.

3.  merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.

The process is visualized below. When elements are moved to the bottom of the picture, they are going through the `merge` step:

![merge sort](images/MergeSort.gif)

The pseudocode for the algorithm is as follows.

`procedure mergesort( a as array )    if ( n == 1 ) return a     /* Split the array into two */    var l1 as array = a[0] ... a[n/2]    var l2 as array = a[n/2+1] ... a[n]     l1 = mergesort( l1 )    l2 = mergesort( l2 )     return merge( l1, l2 ) end procedure  procedure merge( a as array, b as array )    var result as array    while ( a and b have elements )       if ( a[0] > b[0] )          add b[0] to the end of result          remove b[0] from b       else          add a[0] to the end of result          remove a[0] from a       end if    end while     while ( a has elements )       add a[0] to the end of result       remove a[0] from a    end while     while ( b has elements )       add b[0] to the end of result       remove b[0] from b    end while     return result end procedure`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Sort
==========

Quick Sort has a similar “divide and conquer” strategy to Merge Sort. Here are a few key ideas that will motivate the design:

-   it is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value
-   an array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted

Regarding that first point, for example given `[7, 3, 8, 9, 2]` and a target of `5` , we know `[3, 2]` are numbers less than `5` and `[7, 8, 9]` are numbers greater than `5` .

How does it work?
-----------------

In general, the strategy is to divide the input array into two subarrays: one with the smaller elements, and one with the larger elements. Then, it recursively operates on the two new subarrays. It continues this process until of dividing into smaller arrays until it reaches subarrays of length 1 or smaller. As you have seen with Merge Sort, arrays of such length are automatically sorted.

The steps, when discussed on a high level, are simple:

1.  choose an element called “the pivot”, how that's done is up to the

    implementation

2.  take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot
3.  left points to the low index
4.  right points to the high
5.  while value at left is less than pivot move right
6.  while value at right is greater than pivot move left
7.  if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right
8.  if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
9.  repeat, recursively calling this for smaller and smaller arrays

Before we move forward, see if you can observe the behavior described above in the following animation:

![quick sort](images/QuickSort.gif)

The algorithm: divide and conquer
---------------------------------

Formally, we want to partition elements of an array relative to a pivot value. That is, we want elements less than the pivot to be separated from elements that are greater than or equal to the pivot. Our goal is to create a function with this behavior:

    code class="language-javascript"let arr = [7, 3, 8, 9, 2];
            partition(arr, 5); // => [[3, 2], [7,8,9]]
            

### Partition

Seems simple enough! Let's implement it in JavaScript:

    code class="language-javascript"// nothing fancy
    function partition(array, pivot) {
     let left = [];
     let right = [];

     array.forEach(el => {
     if (el <
        pivot) {
     left.push(el);
     } else
        {
     right.push(el);
     }
     });

     return [left, right];
    }

    // if you fancy
    function partition(array, pivot) {
     let left = array.filter(el => el < pivot);
     let right = array.filter(el => el >= pivot);
     return [left, right];
    }

You don't have to use an explicit `partition` helper function in your Quick Sort implementation; however, we will borrow heavily from this pattern. As you design algorithms, it helps to think about key patterns in isolation, although your solution may not feature that exact helper. Some would say we like to divide and conquer.

The pseudocode
--------------

It is *so* small, this algorithm. It's amazing that it performs so well with so little code!

`procedure quickSort(left, right)    if the length of the array is 0 or 1, return the array    set the pivot to the first element of the array   remove the first element of the array    put all values less than the pivot value into an array called left   put all values greater than the pivot value into an array called right    call quick sort on left and assign the return value to leftSorted   call quick sort on right and assign the return value to rightSorted    return the concatenation of leftSorted, the pivot value, and rightSorted  end procedure`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary Search
=============

We've explored many ways to sort arrays so far, but why did we go through all of that trouble? By sorting elements of an array, we are organizing the data in a way that gives us a quick way to look up elements later on. For simplicity, we have been using arrays of numbers up until this point. However, these sorting concepts can be generalized to other data types. For example, it would be easy to modify our comparison-based sorting algorithms to sort strings: instead of leveraging facts like `0 < 1` , we can say `'A' < 'B'` .

Think of a dictionary. A dictionary contains alphabetically sorted words and their definitions. A dictionary is pretty much only useful if it is ordered in this way. Let's say you wanted to look up the definition of “stupendous.” What steps might you take?

-   you open up the dictionary at the roughly middle page
    -   you land in the “m” section
-   you know “s” comes somewhere after “m” in the book, so you disregard all pages

    before the “m” section. Instead, you flip to the roughly middle page between “m” and “z”

    -   you land in the “u” section

-   you know “s” comes somewhere before “u”, so you can disregard all pages after

    the “u” section. Instead, you flip to the roughly middle page between the previous “m” page and “u”

-   …

You are essentially using the `binarySearch` algorithm in the real world.

The Algorithm: “check the middle and half the search space”
-----------------------------------------------------------

Formally, our `binarySearch` will seek to solve the following problem:

`Given a sorted array of numbers and a target num, return a boolean indicating whether     or not that target is contained in the array.`

Programmatically, we want to satisfy the following behavior:

    code class="language-javascript"binarySearch([5, 10, 12,
                15, 20,
                30, 70],
                12); // =>
                    true
            binarySearch([5, 10,
                12, 15,
                20, 30,
                70], 24); // =>
                    false

Before we move on, really internalize the fact that `binarySearch` will only work on **sorted** arrays! Obviously we can search any array, sorted or unsorted, in `O(n)` time. But now our goal is be able to search the array with a sub-linear time complexity (less than `O(n)` ).

The pseudocode
--------------

`procedure binary search (list, target)   parameter list: a list of sorted value   parameter target: the value to search for    if the list has zero length, then return false    determine the slice point:     if the list has an even number of elements,       the slice point is the number of elements       divided by two     if the list has an odd number of elements,       the slice point is the number of elements       minus one divided by two    create an list of the elements from 0 to the     slice point, not including the slice point,     which is known as the "left half"   create an list of the elements from the     slice point to the end of the list which is     known as the "right half"    if the target is less than the value in the     original array at the slice point, then     return the binary search of the "left half"     and the target   if the target is greater than the value in the     original array at the slice point, then     return the binary search of the "right half"     and the target   if neither of those is true, return true end procedure binary search`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bubble Sort Analysis
====================

Bubble Sort manipulates the array by swapping the position of two elements. To implement Bubble Sort in JS, you'll need to perform this operation. It helps to have a function to do that. A key detail in this function is that you need an extra variable to store one of the elements since you will be overwriting them in the array:

    code class="language-javascript"function swap(array, idx1, idx2) {
     let temp = array[idx1]; // save a copy of the first value
     array[idx1] = array[idx2];
        // overwrite the first value with the second value
     array[idx2] = temp; // overwrite the second value with the first value
    }

Note that the swap function does not create or return a new array. It mutates the original array:

    code class="language-javascript"let arr1 = [2, 8, 5, 2, 6];
    swap(arr1, 1, 2);
    arr1; // => [ 2, 5, 8, 2, 6
            ]

### Bubble Sort JS Implementation

Take a look at the snippet below and try to understand how it corresponds to the conceptual understanding of the algorithm. Scroll down to the commented version when you get stuck.

    code class="language-javascript"function bubbleSort(array) {
     let swapped = true;

     while (swapped) {
     swapped = false;

     for (let i
        = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
     if (array[i] > array[i
        + 1]) {
     swap(array,
        i, i + 1);
     swapped = true;
     }
     }
     }

     return array;
    }

    code class="language-javascript"// commented
    function bubbleSort(array) {
     // this variable will be used to track whether or not
            we
     // made a swap on the previous pass. If we did not
            make
     // any swap on the previous pass, then the array
            must
     // already be sorted
     let swapped = true;

     // this while will keep doing passes if a swap was
            made
     // on the previous pass
     while (swapped) {
     swapped = false; // reset swap to
            false

     // this for will perform a single
            pass
     for (let
        i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
        {

     // if the two value are not
            ordered...
     if (array[i] > array[i
        + 1]) {

     // swap the two values
     swap(array, i, i + 1);

     // since you made a swap, remember that you did
            so
     // b/c we should perform another pass after this
            one
     swapped = true;
     }
     }
     }

     return array;
    }

Time Complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
---------------------------------

Picture the worst case scenario where the input array is completely unsorted. Say it's sorted in fully decreasing order, but the goal is to sort it in increasing order:

-   n is the length of the input array
-   The inner `for` loop along contributes *O(n)* in isolation
-   The outer while loop contributes *O(n)* in isolation because a single

    iteration of the while loop will bring one element to its final resting position. In other words, it keeps running the while loop until the array is fully sorted. To fully sort the array we will need to bring all `n` elements into their final resting positions.

-   Those two loops are nested so the total time complexity is O(n \* n) =

    O(n<sup>2</sup>).

It's worth mentioning that the best case scenario is when the input array is already fully sorted. This will cause our for loop to conduct a single pass without performing any swap, so the `while` loop will not trigger further iterations. This means best case time complexity is *O(n)* for bubble sort. This best case linear time is probably the only advantage of bubble sort. Programmers are usually interested only in the worst-case analysis and ignore best-case analysis.

Space Complexity: O(1)
----------------------

Bubble Sort is a constant space, O(1), algorithm. The amount of memory consumed by the algorithm does not increase relative to the size of the input array. It uses the same amount of memory and create the same amount of variables regardless of the size of the input, making this algorithm quite space efficient. The space efficiency mostly comes from the fact that it mutates the input array in-place. This is known as a **destructive sort** because it “destroys” the positions of the values in the array.

When should you use Bubble Sort?
--------------------------------

Nearly never, but it may be a good choice in the following list of special cases:

-   When sorting really small arrays where run time will be negligible no matter

    what algorithm you choose.

-   When sorting arrays that you expect to already be nearly sorted.
-   At parties

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selection Sort Analysis
=======================

Since a component of Selection Sort requires us to locate the smallest value in the array, let's focus on that pattern in isolation:

    code class="language-javascript"function minumumValueIndex(arr) {
        let minIndex = 0;

     for (let j
        = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
     if (arr[minIndex] > arr[j]) {
     minIndex = j;
     }
     }

     return minIndex;
    }

Pretty basic code right? We won't use this explicit helper function to solve selection sort, however we will borrow from this pattern soon.

Selection Sort JS Implementation
--------------------------------

We'll also utilize the classic swap pattern that we introduced in the bubble sort. To refresh:

    code class="language-javascript"function swap(arr, index1, index2) {
     let temp = arr[index1];
     arr[index1] = arr[index2];
     arr[index2] = temp;
    }

Now for the punchline! Take a look at the snippet below and try to understand how it corresponds to our conceptual understanding of the selection sort algorithm. Scroll down to the commented version when you get stuck.

    code class="language-javascript"function selectionSort(arr) {
     for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
     let minIndex = i;

     for (let j
        = i + 1; j < arr.length;
        j++) {
     if (arr[minIndex] >
        arr[j]) {
     minIndex = j;
     }
     }

     swap(arr,
        i, minIndex);
     }
     return arr;
    }

    code class="language-javascript"// commented
    function selectionSort(arr) {
        // the `i` loop will track the index that points to the first element of the unsorted region:
        //    this means that the sorted region is everything left of index i
        //    and the unsorted region is everything to the right of index i
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            let minIndex = i;

     // the `j` loop will iterate through the unsorted
            region and find the index of the smallest element
     for (let
        j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
     if (arr[minIndex] > arr[j]) {
     minIndex = j;
     }
     }

     // after we find the minIndex in the unsorted
            region,
     // swap that minIndex with the first index of
            the unsorted region
     swap(arr,
        i, minIndex);
     }
     return arr;
    }

Time Complexity Analysis
------------------------

Selection Sort runtime is O(n<sup>2</sup>) because:

-   `n` is the length of the input array
-   The outer loop i contributes O(n) in isolation, this is plain to see
-   The inner loop j is more complicated, it will make one less iteration for

    every iteration of i.

    -   for example, let's say we have an array of 10 elements, `n = 10`.
    -   the first full cycle of `j` will have 9 iterations
    -   the second full cycle of `j` will have 8 iterations
    -   the third full cycle of `j` will have 7 iterations
    -   …
    -   the last full cycle of `j` will have 1 iteration
    -   This means that the inner loop j will contribute roughly O(n / 2) on

        average

-   The two loops are nested so our total time complexity is O(n \* n / 2) =

    O(n<sup>2</sup>)

You'll notice that during this analysis we said something silly like O(n / 2). In some analyses such as this one, we'll prefer to drop the constants only at the end of the sketch so you understand the logical steps we took to derive a complicated time complexity.

Space Complexity Analysis: O(1)
-------------------------------

The amount of memory consumed by the algorithm does not increase relative to the size of the input array. We use the same amount of memory and create the same amount of variables regardless of the size of our input. A quick indicator of this is the fact that we don't create any arrays.

When should we use Selection Sort?
----------------------------------

There is really only one use case where Selection Sort becomes superior to Bubble Sort. Both algorithms are quadratic in time and constant in space, but the point at which they differ is in the *number of swaps* they make.

Bubble Sort, in the worst case, invokes a swap on every single comparison. Selection Sort only swaps once our inner loop has completely finished traversing the array. Therefore, Selection Sort is optimized to make the least possible number of swaps.

Selection Sort becomes advantageous when making a swap is the most expensive operation in your system. You will likely rarely encounter this scenario, but in a situation where you've built (or have inherited) a system with suboptimal write speed ability, for instance, maybe you're sorting data in a specialized database tuned strictly for fast read speeds at the expense of slow write speeds, using Selection Sort would save you a ton of expensive operations that could potential crash your system under peak load.

Though in industry this situation is very rare, the insights above make for a fantastic conversational piece when weighing technical tradeoffs while strategizing solutions in an interview setting. This commentary may help deliver the impression that you are well-versed in system design and technical analysis, a key indicator that someone is prepared for a senior level position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insertion Sort Analysis
=======================

Take a look at the snippet below and try to understand how it corresponds to our conceptual understanding of the Insertion Sort algorithm. Scroll down to the commented version when you get stuck:

    code class="language-javascript"function insertionSort(arr) {
     for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
     let currElement =
        arr[i];
     for (var j = i - 1; j >= 0 && currElement < arr[j]; j--) {
     arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
     }
     arr[j + 1] = currElement;
     }
     return arr;
    }

    code class="language-javascript"function insertionSort(arr) {
        // the `i` loop will iterate through every element of the array
        // we begin at i = 1, because we can consider the first element of the array as a
        // trivially sorted region of only one element
        // insertion sort allows us to insert new elements anywhere within the sorted region
        for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // grab the first element of the unsorted region
            let currElement = arr[i];

     // the `j` loop will iterate left through the
            sorted region,
     // looking for a legal spot to insert
            currElement
     for (var
        j = i - 1; j >= 0 && currElement < arr[j]; j--) {
     // keep moving left while currElement is less
            than the j-th element

     arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
     // the line above will move the j-th element to
            the right,
     // leaving a gap to potentially insert
            currElement
     }
     // insert currElement into that gap
     arr[j + 1] = currElement;
     }
     return arr;
    }

There are a few key pieces to point out in the above solution before moving forward:

1.  The outer `for` loop starts at the 1st index, not the 0th index, and moves to

    the right.

2.  The inner `for` loop starts immediately to the left of the current element,

    and moves to the left.

3.  The condition for the inner `for` loop is complicated, and behaves similarly

    to a while loop!

    -   It continues iterating to the left toward `j = 0`, *only while* the

`currElement` is less than `arr[j]` .

`- It does this over and over until it finds the proper place to insert`

`currElement` , and then we exit the inner loop!

1.  When shifting elements in the sorted region to the right, it *does not*

    replace the value at their old index! If the input array is `[1, 2, 4,                 3]` , and `currElement` is `3` , after comparing `4` and `3` , but before inserting `3` between `2` and `4` , the array will look like this: `[1, 2, 4, 4]` .

If you are currently scratching your head, that is perfectly okay because when this one clicks, it clicks for good.

If you're struggling, you should try taking out a pen and paper and step through the solution provided above one step at a time. Keep track of `i` , `j` , `currElement` , `arr[j]` , and the input `arr` itself *at every step*. After going through this a few times, you'll have your “ah HA!” moment.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis
----------------------------------

Insertion Sort runtime is O(n<sup>2</sup>) because:

In the **worst case scenario** where our input array is entirely unsorted, since this algorithm contains a nested loop, its run time behaves similarly to `bubbleSort` and `selectionSort` . In this case, we are forced to make a comparison at each iteration of the inner loop. Not convinced? Let's derive the complexity. We'll use much of the same argument as we did in `selectionSort` . Say we had the worst case scenario where are input array is sorted in full decreasing order, but we wanted to sort it in increasing order:

-   `n` is the length of the input array
-   The outer loop i contributes O(n) in isolation, this is plain to see
-   The inner loop j is more complicated. We know j will iterate until it finds an

    appropriate place to insert the `currElement` into the sorted region. However, since we are discussing the case where the data is already in decreasing order, the element must travel the maximum distance to find it's insertion point! We know this insertion point to be index 0, since every `currElement`

    will be the next smallest of the array. So:

    -   the 1st element travels 1 distance to be inserted
    -   the 2nd element travels 2 distance to be inserted
    -   the 3rd element travels 3 distance to be inserted
    -   …
    -   the n-1th element travels n-1 distance to be inserted
    -   This means that our inner loop j will contribute roughly O(n / 2) on

        average

-   The two loops are nested so our total time complexity is O(n \* n / 2) =

    O(n<sup>2</sup>)

### Space Complexity: O(1)

The amount of memory consumed by the algorithm does not increase relative to the size of the input array. We use the same amount of memory and create the same amount of variables regardless of the size of our input. A quick indicator of this is the fact that we don't create any arrays.

When should you use Insertion Sort?
-----------------------------------

Insertion Sort has one advantage that makes it absolutely supreme in one special case. Insertion Sort is what's known as an “online” algorithm. Online algorithms are great when you're dealing with *streaming data*, because they can sort the data live *as it is received*.

If you must sort a set of data that is ever-incoming, for example, maybe you are sorting the most relevant posts in a social media feed so that those posts that are most likely to impact the site's audience always appear at the top of the feed, an online algorithm like Insertion Sort is a great option.

Insertion Sort works well in this situation because the left side of the array is always sorted, and in the case of nearly sorted arrays, it can run in linear time. The absolute best case scenario for Insertion Sort is when there is only one unsorted element, and it is located all the way to the right of the array.

Well, if you have data constantly being pushed to the array, it will always be added to the right side. If you keep your algorithm constantly running, the left side will always be sorted. Now you have linear time sort.

Otherwise, Insertion Sort is, in general, useful in all the same situations as Bubble Sort. It's a good option when:

-   You are sorting really small arrays where run time will be negligible no

    matter what algorithm we choose.

-   You are sorting an array that you expect to already be nearly sorted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merge Sort Analysis
===================

You needed to come up with two pieces of code to make merge sort work.

Full code
---------

    code class="language-javascript"function merge(array1, array2) {
     let merged = [];

     while (array1.length || array2.length) {
     let ele1 =
        array1.length ? array1[0] : Infinity;
     let ele2 =
        array2.length ? array2[0] : Infinity;

     let next;
     if (ele1 < ele2) {
     next = array1.shift();
     } else
        {
     next = array2.shift();
     }

     merged.push(next);
     }

     return merged;
    }

    function mergeSort(array)
        {
     if (array.length <= 1) {
     return array;
     }

     let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
     let leftHalf = array.slice(0,
        midIdx);
     let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx);

     let sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
     let sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);

     return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
    }

Merging two sorted arrays
-------------------------

Merging two sorted arrays is simple. Since both arrays are sorted, we know the smallest numbers to always be at the front of the arrays. We can construct the new array by comparing the first elements of both input arrays. We remove the smaller element from it's respective array and add it to our new array. Do this until both input arrays are empty:

    code class="language-javascript"function merge(array1, array2) {
        let merged = [];

        while (array1.length || array2.length) {
            let ele1 = array1.length ? array1[0] : Infinity;
            let ele2 = array2.length ? array2[0] : Infinity;

            let next;
            if (ele1 < ele2) {
                next = array1.shift();
            } else {
                next = array2.shift();
            }

            merged.push(next);
        }

        return merged;
    }

Remember the following about JavaScript to understand the above code.

-   `0` is considered a falsey value, meaning it acts like `false` when used in

    Boolean expressions. All other numbers are truthy.

-   `Infinity` is a value that is guaranteed to be greater than any other quantity
-   `shift` is an array method that removes and returns the first element

Here's the annotated version.

    code class="language-javascript"// commented
    function merge(array1, array2) {
        let merged = [];

        // keep running while either array still contains elements
        while (array1.length || array2.length) {
            // if array1 is nonempty, take its the first element as ele1
            // otherwise array1 is empty, so take Infinity as ele1
            let ele1 = array1.length ? array1[0] : Infinity;

            // do the same for array2, ele2
            let ele2 = array2.length ? array2[0] : Infinity;

            let next;
            // remove the smaller of the eles from it's array
            if (ele1 < ele2) {
                next = array1.shift();
            } else {
                next = array2.shift();
            }

            // and add that ele to the new array
            merged.push(next);
        }

        return merged;
    }

By using `Infinity` as the default element when an array is empty, we are able to elegantly handle the scenario where one array empties before the other. We know that any actual element will be less than `Infinity` so we will continually take the other element into our merged array.

In other words, we can safely handle this edge case:

    code class="language-javascript"merge([10,
                13, 15,
                25], []);
                //
                    => [10, 13, 15, 25]

Nice! We now have a way to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array. It's worth mentioning that `merge` will have a `O(n)` runtime where `n` is the combined length of the two input arrays. This is what we meant when we said it was “easy” to merge two sorted arrays; linear time is fast! We'll find fact this useful later.

Divide and conquer, step-by-step
--------------------------------

Now that we satisfied the merge idea, let's handle the second point. That is, we say an array of 1 or 0 elements is already sorted. This will be the base case of our recursion. Let's begin adding this code:

    code class="language-javascript"function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }
     // ....
    }

If our base case pertains to an array of a very small size, then the design of our recursive case should make progress toward hitting this base scenario. In other words, we should recursively call `mergeSort` on smaller and smaller arrays. A logical way to do this is to take the input array and split it into left and right halves.

    code class="language-javascript"function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

     let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
     let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
     let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx);

     let sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
     let sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);
     // ...
    }

Here is the part of the recursion where we do a lot of hand waving and we take things on faith. We know that `mergeSort` will take in an array and return the sorted version; we assume that it works. That means the two recursive calls will return the `sortedLeft` and `sortedRight` halves.

Okay, so we have two sorted arrays. We want to return one sorted array. So `merge` them! Using the `merge` function we designed earlier:

    code class="language-javascript"function mergeSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

        let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
        let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
        let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx);

        let sortedLeft = mergeSort(leftHalf);
        let sortedRight = mergeSort(rightHalf);

        return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
    }

Wow. that's it. Notice how light the implementation of `mergeSort` is. Much of the heavy lifting (the actually comparisons) is done by the `merge` helper.

`mergeSort` is a classic example of a “Divide and Conquer” algorithm. In other words, we keep breaking the array into smaller and smaller sub arrays. This is the same as saying we take the problem and break it down into smaller and smaller subproblems. We do this until the subproblems are so small that we trivially know the answer to them (an array length 0 or 1 is already sorted). Once we have those subanswers we can combine to reconstruct the larger problems that we previously divided (merge the left and right subarrays).

Time and Space Complexity Analysis
----------------------------------

### Time Complexity: O(n log(n))

-   `n` is the length of the input array
-   We must calculate how many recursive calls we make. The number of recursive

    calls is the number of times we must split the array to reach the base case. Since we split in half each time, the number of recursive calls is `O(log(n))` .

    -   for example, say we had an array of length `32`
    -   then the length would change as `32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2                         ->                         1`, we have to

        split 5 times before reaching the base case, `log(32) = 5`

    -   in our algorithm, **log(n)** describes how many times we must halve **n**

        until the quantity reaches 1.

-   Besides the recursive calls, we must consider the while loop within the

`merge` function, which contributes `O(n)` in isolation

-   We call `merge` in every recursive `mergeSort` call, so the total complexity

    is **O(n \* log(n))**

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Merge Sort is the first non-O(1) space sorting algorithm we've seen thus far.

The larger the size of our input array, the greater the number of subarrays we must create in memory. These are not free! They each take up finite space, and we will need a new subarray for each element in the original input. Therefore, Merge Sort has a linear space complexity, O(n).

### When should you use Merge Sort?

Unless we, the engineers, have access in advance to some unique, exploitable insight about our dataset, it turns out that O(n log n) time is *the best* we can do when sorting unknown datasets.

That means that Merge Sort is fast! It's way faster than Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. However, due to its linear space complexity, we must always weigh the trade off between speed and memory consumption when making the choice to use Merge Sort. Consider the following:

-   If you have unlimited memory available, use it, it's fast!
-   If you have a decent amount of memory available and a medium sized dataset,

    run some tests first, but use it!

-   In other cases, maybe you should consider other options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quick Sort
==========

Let's begin structuring the recursion. The base case of any recursive problem is where the input is so trivial, we immediately know the answer without calculation. If our problem is to sort an array, what is the trivial array? An array of 1 or 0 elements! Let's establish the code:

    code class="language-javascript"function quickSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }
     // ...
    }

If our base case pertains to an array of a very small size, then the design of our recursive case should make progress toward hitting this base scenario. In other words, we should recursively call `quickSort` on smaller and smaller arrays. This is very similar to our previous `mergeSort` , except we don't just split the array down the middle. Instead we should arbitrarily choose an element of the array as a pivot and partition the remaining elements relative to this pivot:

    code class="language-javascript"function quickSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

     let pivot =
        array.shift();
     let left =
        array.filter(el => el < pivot);
     let right =
        array.filter(el => el >= pivot);
     // ...

Here is what to notice about the partition step above:

1.  the pivot is an element of the array; we arbitrarily chose the first element
2.  we removed the pivot from the master array before we filter into the left and

    right partitions

Now that we have the two subarrays of `left` and `right` we have our subproblems! To solve these subproblems we must sort the subarrays. I wish we had a function that sorts an array…oh wait we do, `quickSort` ! Recursively:

    code class="language-javascript"function quickSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

     let pivot =
        array.shift();
     let left =
        array.filter(el => el < pivot);
     let right =
        array.filter(el => el >= pivot);

     let leftSorted = quickSort(left);
     let rightSorted = quickSort(right);
     // ...

Okay, so we have the two sorted partitions. This means we have the two subsolutions. But how do we put them together? Think about how we partitioned them in the first place. Everything in `leftSorted` is **guaranteed** to be less than everything in `rightSorted` . On top of that, `pivot` should be placed after the last element in `leftSorted` , but before the first element in `rightSorted` . So all we need to do is to combine the elements in the order “left, pivot, right”!

    code class="language-javascript"function quickSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

        let pivot = array.shift();
        let left = array.filter(el => el < pivot);
        let right = array.filter(el => el >= pivot);

        let leftSorted = quickSort(left);
        let rightSorted = quickSort(right);

        return leftSorted.concat([pivot]).concat(rightSorted);
    }

That last `concat` line is a bit clunky. Bonus JS Lesson: we can use the spread `...` operator to elegantly concatenate arrays. In general:

    code class="language-javascript"let one = ['a', 'b']
    let two = ['d', 'e', 'f']
    let newArr = [...one, 'c', ...two];
    newArr; // =>  [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' ]

Utilizing that spread pattern gives us this final implementation:

    code class="language-javascript"function quickSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

     let pivot =
        array.shift();
     let left =
        array.filter(el => el < pivot);
     let right =
        array.filter(el => el >= pivot);

     let leftSorted = quickSort(left);
     let rightSorted = quickSort(right);

     return [...leftSorted, pivot, ...rightSorted];
    }

### Quicksort Sort JS Implementation

That code was so clean we should show it again. Here's the complete code for your reference, for when you `ctrl+F "quicksort"` the night before an interview:

    code class="language-javascript"function quickSort(array) {
        if (array.length <= 1) {
            return array;
        }

        let pivot = array.shift();
        let left = array.filter(el => el < pivot);
        let right = array.filter(el => el >= pivot);

        let leftSorted = quickSort(left);
        let rightSorted = quickSort(right);

        return [...leftSorted, pivot, ...rightSorted];
    }

Time and Space Complexity Analysis
----------------------------------

Here is a summary of the complexity.

### Time Complexity

-   Avg Case: O(n log(n))
-   Worst Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

The runtime analysis of `quickSort` is more complex than `mergeSort`

-   `n` is the length of the input array
-   The partition step alone is `O(n)`
-   We must calculate how many recursive calls we make. The number of recursive

    calls is the number of times we must split the array to reach the base case. This is dependent on how we choose the pivot. Let's analyze the best and worst case:

    -   **Best Case:** We are lucky and always choose the median as the pivot.

        This means the left and right partitions will have equal length. This will halve the array length at every step of the recursion. We benefit from this halving with `O(log(n))` recursive calls to reach the base case.

    -   **Worst Case:** We are unlucky and always choose the min or max as the

        pivot. This means one partition will contain everything, and the other partition is empty. This will decrease the array length by 1 at every step of the recursion. We suffer from `O(n)` recursive calls to reach the base case.

-   The partition step occurs in every recursive call, so our total complexities

    are:

    -   **Best Case:** O(n \* log(n))
    -   **Worst Case:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Although we typically take the worst case when describing Big-O for an algorithm, much research on `quickSort` has shown the worst case to be an exceedingly rare occurrence even if we choose the pivot at random. Because of this we still consider `quickSort` an efficient algorithm. This is a common interview talking point, so you should be familiar with the relationship between the choice of pivot and efficiency of the algorithm.

Just in case: A somewhat common question a student may ask when studying `quickSort` is, “If the median is the best pivot, why don't we always just choose the median when we partition?” Don't overthink this. To know the median of an array, it must be sorted in the first place.

### Space Complexity

Our implementation of `quickSort` uses `O(n)` space because of the partition arrays we create. There is an in-place version of `quickSort` that uses `O(log(n))` space. `O(log(n))` space is not huge benefit over `O(n)` . You'll also find our version of `quickSort` as easier to remember, easier to implement. Just know that a `O(logn)` space `quickSort` exists.

### When should you use Quick Sort?

-   When you are in a pinch and need to throw down an efficient sort (on average).

    The recursive code is light and simple to implement; much smaller than `mergeSort` .

-   When constant space is important to you, use the in-place version. This will

    of course trade off some simplicity of implementation.

If you know some constraints about dataset you can make some modifications to optimize pivot choice. Here's some food for thought. Our implementation of `quickSort` will always take the first element as the pivot. This means we will suffer from the worst case time complexity in the event that we are given an already sorted array (ironic isn't it?). If you know your input data to be mostly already sorted, randomize the choice of pivot - this is a very easy change. Bam. Solved like a true engineer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary Search
=============

We'll implement binary search recursively. As always, we start with a base case that captures the scenario of the input array being so trivial, that we know the answer without further calculation. If we are given an empty array and a target, we can be certain that the target is not inside of the array:

    code class="language-javascript"function binarySearch(array, target) {
        if (array.length === 0) {
            return false;
        }
     // ...
    }

Now for our recursive case. If we want to get a time complexity less than `O(n)` , we must avoid touching all `n` elements. Adopting our dictionary strategy, let's find the middle element and grab references to the left and right halves of the sorted array:

    code class="language-javascript"function binarySearch(array, target) {
        if (array.length === 0) {
            return false;
        }

     let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
     let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
     let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx
        + 1);
     // ...
    }

It's worth pointing out that the left and right halves do not contain the middle element we chose.

Here is where we leverage the sorted property of the array. If the target is less than the middle, then the target must be in the left half of the array. If the target is greater than the middle, then the target must be in the right half of the array. So we can narrow our search to one of these halves, and ignore the other. Luckily we have a function that can search the half, its `binarySearch` :

    code class="language-javascript"function binarySearch(array, target) {
        if (array.length === 0) {
            return false;
        }

     let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
     let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
     let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx
        + 1);

     if (target < array[midIdx]) {
     return binarySearch(leftHalf, target);
     } else
        if (target > array[midIdx]) {
     return binarySearch(rightHalf, target);
     }
     // ...
    }

We know `binarySeach` will return the correct Boolean, so we just pass that result up by returning it ourselves. However, something is lacking in our code. It is only possible to get a false from the literal `return false` line, but there is no `return         true` . Looking at our conditionals, we handle the cases where the target is less than middle or the target is greater than the middle, but what if the product is **equal** to the middle? If the target is equal to the middle, then we found the target and should `return true` ! This is easy to add with an `else` :

    code class="language-javascript"function binarySearch(array, target) {
        if (array.length === 0) {
            return false;
        }

     let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
     let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
     let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx
        + 1);

     if (target < array[midIdx]) {
     return binarySearch(leftHalf, target);
     } else
        if (target > array[midIdx]) {
     return binarySearch(rightHalf, target);
     } else
        {
     return true;
     }
    }

To wrap up, we have confidence of our base case will eventually be hit because we are continually halving the array. We halve the array until it's length is 0 or we actually find the target.

### Binary Search JS Implementation

Here is the code again for your quick reference:

    code class="language-javascript"function binarySearch(array, target) {
        if (array.length === 0) {
            return false;
        }

        let midIdx = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
        let leftHalf = array.slice(0, midIdx);
        let rightHalf = array.slice(midIdx + 1);

        if (target < array[midIdx]) {
            return binarySearch(leftHalf, target);
        } else if (target > array[midIdx]) {
            return binarySearch(rightHalf, target);
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }

Time and Space Complexity Analysis
----------------------------------

The complexity analysis of this algorithm is easier to explain through visuals, so we **highly encourage** you to watch the lecture that accompanies this reading. In any case, here is a summary of the complexity:

### Time Complexity: O(log(n))

-   `n` is the length of the input array
-   We have no loops, so we must only consider the number of recursive calls it

    takes to hit the base case

-   The number of recursive calls is the number of times we must halve the array

    until it's length becomes 0. This number can be described by `log(n)`

    -   for example, say we had an array of 8 elements, `n = 8`
    -   the length would halve as `8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1`
    -   it takes 3 calls, `log(8) = 3`

### Space Complexity: O(n)

Our implementation uses `n` space due to half arrays we create using slice. Note that JavaScript `slice` creates a new array, so it requires additional memory to be allocated.

### When should we use Binary Search?

Use this algorithm when the input data is sorted!!! This is a heavy requirement, but if you have it, you'll have an insanely fast algorithm. Of course, you can use one of your high-functioning sorting algorithms to sort the input and *then* perform the binary search!

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement Merge Sort. In the file **lib/merge\_sort.js**, you should implement the Merge Sort.

The algorithm can be summarized as the following:

1.  if there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted. return that

    array.

2.  otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more

    be divided.

3.  merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Binary Search
=============

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement Binary Search. In the file **lib/binary\_search.js**, you should implement the Binary Search and its cousin Binary Search Index.

The Binary Search algorithm can be summarized as the following:

1.  If the array is empty, then return false
2.  Check the value in the middle of the array against the target value
3.  If the value is equal to the target value, then return true
4.  If the value is less than the target value, then return the binary search on

    the left half of the array for the target

5.  If the value is greater than the target value, then return the binary search

    on the right half of the array for the target

This is a description of how the Binary Search works (and is also in the code file).

`procedure binary search (list, target)     parameter list: a list of sorted value     parameter target: the value to search for      if the list has zero length, then return false      determine the slice point:     if the list has an even number of elements,     the slice point is the number of elements     divided by two     if the list has an odd number of elements,     the slice point is the number of elements     minus one divided by two      create an list of the elements from 0 to the     slice point, not including the slice point,     which is known as the "left half"     create an list of the elements from the     slice point to the end of the list which is     known as the "right half"      if the target is less than the value in the     original array at the slice point, then     return the binary search of the "left half"     and the target     if the target is greater than the value in the     original array at the slice point, then     return the binary search of the "right half"     and the target     if neither of those is true, return true     end procedure binary search`

Then you need to adapt that to return *the index* of the found item rather than a Boolean value. The pseudocode is also in the code file.

`procedure binary search index(list, target, low, high)     parameter list: a list of sorted value     parameter target: the value to search for     parameter low: the lower index for the search     parameter high: the upper index for the search      if low is equal to high, then return -1 to indicate     that the value was not found      determine the slice point:     if the list between the high index and the low index     has an even number of elements,     the slice point is the number of elements     between high and low divided by two     if the list between the high index and the low index     has an odd number of elements,     the slice point is the number of elements     between high and low minus one, divided by two      if the target is less than the value in the     original array at the slice point, then     return the binary search of the array,     the target, low, and the slice point     if the target is greater than the value in the     original array at the slice point, then return     the binary search of the array, the target,     the slice point plus one, and high     if neither of those is true, return the slice point     end procedure binary search index`

Moreover, understanding how different data structures work will influence the libraries and frameworks that you choose when writing software.

When you are done, you will be able to:

1.  Explain and implement a List.
2.  Explain and implement a Stack.
3.  Explain and implement a Queue.me comfortable with

Linked Lists
============

In the university setting, it's common for Linked Lists to appear early on in an undergraduate's Computer Science coursework. While they don't always have the most practical real-world applications in industry, Linked Lists make for an important and effective educational tool in helping develop a student's mental model on what data structures actually are to begin with.

Linked lists are simple. They have many compelling, reoccurring edge cases to consider that emphasize to the student the need for care and intent while implementing data structures. They can be applied as the underlying data structure while implementing a variety of other prevalent abstract data types, such as Lists, Stacks, and Queues, and they have a level of versatility high enough to clearly illustrate the value of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

They also come up in software engineering interviews quite often.

What is a Linked List?
----------------------

A Linked List data structure represents a linear sequence of “vertices” (or “nodes”), and tracks three important properties.

**Linked List Properties:**

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Property</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">head</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The first node in the list.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">tail</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The last node in the list.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">length</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The number of nodes in the list; the list's length.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The data being tracked by a particular Linked List does not live inside the Linked List instance itself. Instead, each vertex is actually an instance of an even simpler, smaller data structure, often referred to as a “Node”.

Depending on the type of Linked List (there are many), Node instances track some very important properties as well.

**Linked List Node Properties:**

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Property</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">value</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The actual value this node represents.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">next</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The next node in the list (relative to this node).</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">previous</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The previous node in the list (relative to this node).</td></tr></tbody></table>

**NOTE:** The `previous` property is for Doubly Linked Lists only!

Linked Lists contain *ordered* data, just like arrays. The first node in the list is, indeed, first. From the perspective of the very first node in the list, the *next* node is the second node. From the perspective of the second node in the list, the *previous* node is the first node, and the *next* node is the third node. And so it goes.

#### *“So…this sounds a lot like an Array…”*

Admittedly, this does *sound* a lot like an Array so far, and that's because Arrays and Linked Lists are both implementations of the List ADT. However, there is an incredibly important distinction to be made between Arrays and Linked Lists, and that is how they *physically store* their data. (As opposed to how they *represent* the order of their data.)

Recall that Arrays contain *contiguous* data. Each element of an array is actually stored *next to* it's neighboring element *in the actual hardware of your machine*, in a single continuous block in memory.

![Array in Memory](images/array-in-memory.png)

*An Array's contiguous data being stored in a continuous block of addresses in memory.*

  

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists contain *non-contiguous* data. Though Linked Lists *represent* data that is ordered linearly, that mental model is just that - an interpretation of the *representation* of information, not reality.

In reality, in the actual hardware of your machine, whether it be in disk or in memory, a Linked List's Nodes are not stored in a single continuous block of addresses. Rather, Linked List Nodes live at randomly distributed addresses throughout your machine! The only reason we know which node comes next in the list is because we've assigned its reference to the current node's `next`

pointer.

![Array in Memory](images/SLL-diagram.png)

*A Singly Linked List's non-contiguous data (Nodes) being stored at randomly distributed addresses in memory.*

  

For this reason, Linked List Nodes have *no indices*, and no *random access*. Without random access, we do not have the ability to look up an individual Linked List Node in constant time. Instead, to find a particular Node, we have to start at the very first Node and iterate through the Linked List one node at a time, checking each Node's *next* Node until we find the one we're interested in.

So when implementing a Linked List, we actually must implement both the Linked List class *and* the Node class. Since the actual data lives in the Nodes, it's simpler to implement the Node class first.

Types of Linked Lists
---------------------

There are four flavors of Linked List you should be familiar with when walking into your job interviews.

**Linked List Types:**

<table style="width:99%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 16%" /><col style="width: 62%" /><col style="width: 21%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">List Type</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th><th style="text-align: center;">Directionality</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Singly Linked</td><td style="text-align: center;">Nodes have a single pointer connecting them in a single direction.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Head→Tail</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Doubly Linked</td><td style="text-align: center;">Nodes have two pointers connecting them bi-directionally.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Head⇄Tail</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Multiply Linked</td><td style="text-align: center;">Nodes have two or more pointers, providing a variety of potential node orderings.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Head⇄Tail, A→Z, Jan→Dec, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Circularly Linked</td><td style="text-align: center;">Final node's <code class="language-javascript">next</code> pointer points to the first node, creating a non-linear, circular version of a Linked List.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Head→Tail→Head→Tail</td></tr></tbody></table>

**NOTE:** These Linked List types are not always mutually exclusive.

For instance:

-   Any type of Linked List can be implemented Circularly (e.g. A Circular

    Doubly Linked List).

-   A Doubly Linked List is actually just a special case of a Multiply Linked

    List.

You are most likely to encounter Singly and Doubly Linked Lists in your upcoming job search, so we are going to focus exclusively on those two moving forward. However, in more senior level interviews, it is very valuable to have some familiarity with the other types of Linked Lists. Though you may not actually code them out, *you will win extra points by illustrating your ability to weigh the tradeoffs of your technical decisions* by discussing how your choice of Linked List type may affect the efficiency of the solutions you propose.

Linked List Methods
-------------------

Linked Lists are great foundation builders when learning about data structures because they share a number of similar methods (and edge cases) with many other common data structures. You will find that many of the concepts discussed here will repeat themselves as we dive into some of the more complex non-linear data structures later on, like Trees and Graphs.

In the project that follows, we will implement the following Linked List methods:

----------------------------------

Before we begin our analysis, here is a quick summary of the Time and Space constraints of each Linked List Operation. The complexities below apply to both Singly and Doubly Linked Lists:

<table style="width:99%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 26%" /><col style="width: 22%" /><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 26%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Data Structure Operation</th><th style="text-align: center;">Time Complexity (Avg)</th><th style="text-align: center;">Time Complexity (Worst)</th><th style="text-align: center;">Space Complexity (Worst)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Access</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Search</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Insertion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Deletion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Before moving forward, see if you can reason to yourself why each operation has the time and space complexity listed above!

Time Complexity - Access and Search:
------------------------------------

### Scenarios:

1.  We have a Linked List, and we'd like to find the 8th item in the list.
2.  We have a Linked List of sorted alphabet letters, and we'd like to see if the

    letter “Q” is inside that list.

### Discussion:

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists Nodes are not stored contiguously in memory, and thereby do not have an indexed set of memory addresses at which we can quickly lookup individual nodes in constant time. Instead, we must begin at the head of the list (or possibly at the tail, if we have a Doubly Linked List), and iterate through the list until we arrive at the node of interest.

In Scenario 1, we'll know we're there because we've iterated 8 times. In Scenario 2, we'll know we're there because, while iterating, we've checked each node's value and found one that matches our target value, “Q”.

In the worst case scenario, we may have to traverse the entire Linked List until we arrive at the final node. This makes both Access & Search **Linear Time** operations.

Time Complexity - Insertion and Deletion:
-----------------------------------------

### Scenarios:

1.  We have an empty Linked List, and we'd like to insert our first node.
2.  We have a Linked List, and we'd like to insert or delete a node at the Head

    or Tail.

3.  We have a Linked List, and we'd like to insert or delete a node from

    somewhere in the middle of the list.

### Discussion:

Since we have our Linked List Nodes stored in a non-contiguous manner that relies on pointers to keep track of where the next and previous nodes live, Linked Lists liberate us from the linear time nature of Array insertions and deletions. We no longer have to adjust the position at which each node/element is stored after making an insertion at a particular position in the list. Instead, if we want to insert a new node at position `i` , we can simply:

1.  Create a new node.
2.  Set the new node's `next` and `previous` pointers to the nodes that live at

    positions `i` and `i - 1` , respectively.

3.  Adjust the `next` pointer of the node that lives at position `i - 1` to point

    to the new node.

4.  Adjust the `previous` pointer of the node that lives at position `i` to point

    to the new node.

And we're done, in Constant Time. No iterating across the entire list necessary.

“But hold on one second,” you may be thinking. “In order to insert a new node in the middle of the list, don't we have to lookup its position? Doesn't that take linear time?!”

Yes, it is tempting to call insertion or deletion in the middle of a Linked List a linear time operation since there is lookup involved. However, it's usually the case that you'll already have a reference to the node where your desired insertion or deletion will occur.

For this reason, we separate the Access time complexity from the Insertion/Deletion time complexity, and formally state that Insertion and Deletion in a Linked List are **Constant Time** across the board.

### NOTE:

Without a reference to the node at which an insertion or deletion will occur, due to linear time lookup, an insertion or deletion *in the middle* of a Linked List will still take Linear Time, sum total.

Space Complexity:
-----------------

### Scenarios:

1.  We're given a Linked List, and need to operate on it.
2.  We've decided to create a new Linked List as part of strategy to solve some

    problem.

### Discussion:

It's obvious that Linked Lists have one node for every one item in the list, and for that reason we know that Linked Lists take up Linear Space in memory. However, when asked in an interview setting what the Space Complexity *of your solution* to a problem is, it's important to recognize the difference between the two scenarios above.

In Scenario 1, we *are not* creating a new Linked List. We simply need to operate on the one given. Since we are not storing a *new* node for every node represented in the Linked List we are provided, our solution is *not necessarily* linear in space.

In Scenario 2, we *are* creating a new Linked List. If the number of nodes we create is linearly correlated to the size of our input data, we are now operating in Linear Space.

### NOTE:

Linked Lists can be traversed both iteratively and recursively. *If you choose to traverse a Linked List recursively*, there will be a recursive function call added to the call stack for every node in the Linked List. Even if you're provided the Linked List, as in Scenario 1, you will still use Linear Space in the call stack, and that counts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stacks and Queues
=================

Stacks and Queues aren't really “data structures” by the strict definition of the term. The more appropriate terminology would be to call them abstract data types (ADTs), meaning that their definitions are more conceptual and related to the rules governing their user-facing behaviors rather than their core implementations.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to them as data structures and ADTs interchangeably throughout the course, but the distinction is an important one to be familiar with as you level up as an engineer.

Now that that's out of the way, Stacks and Queues represent a linear collection of nodes or values. In this way, they are quite similar to the Linked List data structure we discussed in the previous section. In fact, you can even use a modified version of a Linked List to implement each of them. (Hint, hint.)

These two ADTs are similar to each other as well, but each obey their own special rule regarding the order with which Nodes can be added and removed from the structure.

Since we've covered Linked Lists in great length, these two data structures will be quick and easy. Let's break them down individually in the next couple of sections.

What is a Stack?
----------------

Stacks are a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. The last Node added to a stack is always the first Node to be removed, and as a result, the first Node added is always the last Node removed.

The name Stack actually comes from this characteristic, as it is helpful to visualize the data structure as a vertical stack of items. Personally, I like to think of a Stack as a stack of plates, or a stack of sheets of paper. This seems to make them more approachable, because the analogy relates to something in our everyday lives.

If you can imagine adding items to, or removing items from, a Stack of…literally anything…you'll realize that every (sane) person naturally obeys the LIFO rule.

We add things to the *top* of a stack. We remove things from the *top* of a stack. We never add things to, or remove things from, the *bottom* of the stack. That's just crazy.

Note: We can use JavaScript Arrays to implement a basic stack. `Array#push` adds to the top of the stack and `Array#pop` will remove from the top of the stack. In the exercise that follows, we'll build our own Stack class from scratch (without using any arrays). In an interview setting, your evaluator may be okay with you using an array as a stack.

What is a Queue?
----------------

Queues are a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure. The first Node added to the queue is always the first Node to be removed.

The name Queue comes from this characteristic, as it is helpful to visualize this data structure as a horizontal line of items with a beginning and an end. Personally, I like to think of a Queue as the line one waits on for an amusement park, at a grocery store checkout, or to see the teller at a bank.

If you can imagine a queue of humans waiting…again, for literally anything…you'll realize that *most* people (the civil ones) naturally obey the FIFO rule.

People add themselves to the *back* of a queue, wait their turn in line, and make their way toward the *front*. People exit from the *front* of a queue, but only when they have made their way to being first in line.

We never add ourselves to the front of a queue (unless there is no one else in line), otherwise we would be “cutting” the line, and other humans don't seem to appreciate that.

Note: We can use JavaScript Arrays to implement a basic queue. `Array#push` adds to the back (enqueue) and `Array#shift` will remove from the front (dequeue). In the exercise that follows, we'll build our own Queue class from scratch (without using any arrays). In an interview setting, your evaluator may be okay with you using an array as a queue.

Stack and Queue Properties
--------------------------

Stacks and Queues are so similar in composition that we can discuss their properties together. They track the following three properties:

**Stack Properties | Queue Properties:**

<table style="width:98%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 11%" /><col style="width: 38%" /><col style="width: 11%" /><col style="width: 38%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Stack Property</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th><th style="text-align: center;">Queue Property</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">top</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The first node in the Stack</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">front</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The first node in the Queue.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">—-</td><td style="text-align: center;">Stacks do not have an equivalent</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">back</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The last node in the Queue.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">length</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The number of nodes in the Stack; the Stack's length.</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">length</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The number of nodes in the Queue; the Queue's length.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Notice that rather than having a `head` and a `tail` like Linked Lists, Stacks have a `top` , and Queues have a `front` and a `back` instead. Stacks don't have the equivalent of a `tail` because you only ever push or pop things off the top of Stacks. These properties are essentially the same; pointers to the end points of the respective List ADT where important actions way take place. The differences in naming conventions are strictly for human comprehension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly to Linked Lists, the values stored inside a Stack or a Queue are actually contained within Stack Node and Queue Node instances. Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List Nodes are all identical, but just as a reminder and for the sake of completion, these List Nodes track the following two properties:

**Stack & Queue Node Properties:**

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Property</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">value</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The actual value this node represents.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">next</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">The next node in the Stack (relative to this node).</td></tr></tbody></table>

Stack Methods
-------------

In the exercise that follows, we will implement a Stack data structure along with the following Stack methods:

<table style="width:98%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 11%" /><col style="width: 8%" /><col style="width: 45%" /><col style="width: 34%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Type</th><th style="text-align: center;">Name</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th><th style="text-align: center;">Returns</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Insertion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">push</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">Adds a Node to the top of the Stack.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Integer - New size of stack</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Deletion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">pop</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">Removes a Node from the top of the Stack.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Node removed from top of Stack</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Meta</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">size</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">Returns the current size of the Stack.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Integer</td></tr></tbody></table>

Queue Methods
-------------

In the exercise that follows, we will implement a Queue data structure along with the following Queue methods:

<table style="width:97%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 10%" /><col style="width: 10%" /><col style="width: 44%" /><col style="width: 33%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Type</th><th style="text-align: center;">Name</th><th style="text-align: center;">Description</th><th style="text-align: center;">Returns</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Insertion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">enqueue</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">Adds a Node to the front of the Queue.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Integer - New size of Queue</td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Deletion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">dequeue</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">Removes a Node from the front of the Queue.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Node removed from front of Queue</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Meta</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">size</code></td><td style="text-align: center;">Returns the current size of the Queue.</td><td style="text-align: center;">Integer</td></tr></tbody></table>

Time and Space Complexity Analysis
----------------------------------

Before we begin our analysis, here is a quick summary of the Time and Space constraints of each Stack Operation.

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 26%" /><col style="width: 23%" /><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 26%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th style="text-align: center;">Data Structure Operation</th><th style="text-align: center;">Time Complexity (Avg)</th><th style="text-align: center;">Time Complexity (Worst)</th><th style="text-align: center;">Space Complexity (Worst)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Access</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Search</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: center;">Insertion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td style="text-align: center;">Deletion</td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">Θ(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(1)</code></td><td style="text-align: center;"><code class="language-javascript">O(n)</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Before moving forward, see if you can reason to yourself why each operation has the time and space complexity listed above!

#### Time Complexity - Access and Search:

When the Stack ADT was first conceived, its inventor definitely did not prioritize searching and accessing individual Nodes or values in the list. The same idea applies for the Queue ADT. There are certainly better data structures for speedy search and lookup, and if these operations are a priority for your use case, it would be best to choose something else!

Search and Access are both linear time operations for Stacks and Queues, and that shouldn't be too unclear. Both ADTs are nearly identical to Linked Lists in this way. The only way to find a Node somewhere in the middle of a Stack or a Queue, is to start at the `top` (or the `back` ) and traverse downward (or forward) toward the `bottom` (or `front` ) one node at a time via each Node's `next` property.

This is a linear time operation, O(n).

#### Time Complexity - Insertion and Deletion:

For Stacks and Queues, insertion and deletion is what it's all about. If there is one feature a Stack absolutely must have, it's constant time insertion and removal to and from the `top` of the Stack (FIFO). The same applies for Queues, but with insertion occurring at the `back` and removal occurring at the `front`

(LIFO).

Think about it. When you add a plate to the top of a stack of plates, do you have to iterate through all of the other plates first to do so? Of course not. You simply add your plate to the top of the stack, and that's that. The concept is the same for removal.

Therefore, Stacks and Queues have constant time Insertion and Deletion via their `push` and `pop` or `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods, O(1).

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of Stacks and Queues is very simple. Whether we are instantiating a new instance of a Stack or Queue to store a set of data, or we are using a Stack or Queue as part of a strategy to solve some problem, Stacks and Queues always store one Node for each value they receive as input.

For this reason, we always consider Stacks and Queues to have a linear space complexity, O(n).

When should we use Stacks and Queues?
-------------------------------------

At this point, we've done a lot of work understanding the ins and outs of Stacks and Queues, but we still haven't really discussed what we can use them for. The answer is actually…a lot!

For one, Stacks and Queues can be used as intermediate data structures while implementing some of the more complicated data structures and methods we'll see in some of our upcoming sections.

For example, the implementation of the breadth-first Tree traversal algorithm takes advantage of a Queue instance, and the depth-first Graph traversal algorithm exploits the benefits of a Stack instance.

Additionally, Stacks and Queues serve as the essential underlying data structures to a wide variety of applications you use all the time. Just to name a few:

#### Stacks:

-   The Call Stack is a Stack data structure, and is used to manage the order of

    function invocations in your code.

-   Browser History is often implemented using a Stack, with one great example

    being the browser history object in the very popular React Router module.

-   Undo/Redo functionality in just about any application. For example:
    -   When you're coding in your text editor, each of the actions you take on your

        keyboard are recorded by `push` ing that event to a Stack.

    -   When you hit \[cmd + z\] to undo your most recent action, that event is

`pop` ed off the Stack, because the last event that occured should be the first one to be undone (LIFO).

-   When you hit \[cmd + y\] to redo your most recent action, that event is

`push` ed back onto the Stack.

#### Queues:

-   Printers use a Queue to manage incoming jobs to ensure that documents are

    printed in the order they are received.

-   Chat rooms, online video games, and customer service phone lines use a Queue

    to ensure that patrons are served in the order they arrive.

    -   In the case of a Chat Room, to be admitted to a size-limited room.
    -   In the case of an Online Multi-Player Game, players wait in a lobby until

        there is enough space and it is their turn to be admitted to a game.

    -   In the case of a Customer Service Phone Line…you get the point.

-   As a more advanced use case, Queues are often used as components or services

    in the system design of a service-oriented architecture. A very popular and easy to use example of this is Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS), which is a part of their Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering.

    -   You would add this service to your system between two other services, one

        that is sending information for processing, and one that is receiving information to be processed, when the volume of incoming requests is high and the integrity of the order with which those requests are processed must be maintained.

WEEK-07 DAY-5 *Heaps*
=====================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphs and Heaps
================

**The objective of this lesson** is for you to become comfortable with implementing common data structures. This is important because questions about data structures are incredibly likely to be interview questions for software engineers from junior to senior levels. Moreover, understanding how different data structures work will influence the libraries and frameworks that you choose when writing software.

When you are done, you will be able to:

1.  Explain and implement a Heap.
2.  Explain and implement a Graph.table with

implementing common data structures. This is important because questions about data structures are incredibly likely to be interview questions for software engineers from junior to senior levels. Moreover, understanding how different data structures work will influence the libraries and frameworks that you choose when writing software.

When you are done, you will be able to:

1.  Explain and implement a Heap.
2.  Explain and implement a Graph.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Heaps
=====================

Let's explore the **Heap** data structure! In particular, we'll explore **Binary Heaps**. A binary heap is a type of binary tree. However, a heap is not a binary *search* tree. A heap is a partially ordered data structure, whereas a BST has full order. In a heap, the root of the tree will be the maximum (max heap) or the minimum (min heap). Below is an example of a max heap:

![max\_heap](images/max_heap.png)

Notice that the heap above does not follow search tree property where all values to the left of a node are less and all values to the right are greater or equal. Instead, the max heap invariant is:

-   given any node, its children must be less than or equal to the node

This constraint makes heaps much more relaxed in structure compared to a search tree. There is no guaranteed order among “siblings” or “cousins” in a heap. The relationship only flows down the tree from parent to child. In other words, in a max heap, a node will be greater than all of it's children, it's grandchildren, its great-grandchildren, and so on. A consequence of this is the root being the absolute maximum of the entire tree. We'll be exploring max heaps together, but these arguments are symmetric for a min heap.

### Complete Trees

We'll eventually implement a max heap together, but first we'll need to take a quick detour. Our design goal is to implement a data structure with efficient operations. Since a heap is a type of binary tree, recall the circumstances where we had a “best case” binary tree. We'll need to ensure our heap has minimal height, that is, it must be a balanced tree!

Our heap implementation will not only be balanced, but it will also be **complete**. To clarify, **every complete tree is also a balanced tree**, but not every balanced tree is also complete. Our definition of a complete tree is:

-   a tree where all levels have the maximal number of nodes, except the bottom

    the level

-   AND the bottom level has all nodes filled as far left as possible

Here are few examples of the definition:

![complete\_tree](images/complete_tree.png)

Notice that the tree is on the right fails the second point of our definition because there is a gap in the last level. Informally, you can think about a complete tree as packing its nodes as closely together as possible. This line of thinking will come into play when we code heaps later.

### When to Use Heaps?

Heaps are the most useful when attacking problems that require you to “partially sort” data. This usually takes form in problems that have us calculate the largest or smallest n numbers of a collection. For example: What if you were asked to find the largest 5 numbers in an array in linear time, O(n)? The fastest sorting algorithms are O(n logn), so none of those algorithms will be good enough. However, we can use a heap to solve this problem in linear time.

We'll analyze this in depth when we implement a heap in the next section!

One of the most common uses of a binary heap is to implement a “[priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)”. We learned before that a queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. With a priority queue, items are removed from the queue based on a priority number. The priority number is used to place the items into the heap and pull them out in the correct priority order!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Heaps
=====================

Let's explore the **Heap** data structure! In particular, we'll explore **Binary Heaps**. A binary heap is a type of binary tree. However, a heap is not a binary *search* tree. A heap is a partially ordered data structure, whereas a BST has full order. In a heap, the root of the tree will be the maximum (max heap) or the minimum (min heap). Below is an example of a max heap:

![max\_heap](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/heaps/images/max_heap.png)

Notice that the heap above does not follow search tree property where all values to the left of a node are less and all values to the right are greater or equal. Instead, the max heap invariant is:

-   given any node, its children must be less than or equal to the node

This constraint makes heaps much more relaxed in structure compared to a search tree. There is no guaranteed order among “siblings” or “cousins” in a heap. The relationship only flows down the tree from parent to child. In other words, in a max heap, a node will be greater than all of it's children, it's grandchildren, its great-grandchildren, and so on. A consequence of this is the root being the absolute maximum of the entire tree. We'll be exploring max heaps together, but these arguments are symmetric for a min heap.

### Complete Trees

We'll eventually implement a max heap together, but first we'll need to take a quick detour. Our design goal is to implement a data structure with efficient operations. Since a heap is a type of binary tree, recall the circumstances where we had a “best case” binary tree. We'll need to ensure our heap has minimal height, that is, it must be a balanced tree!

Our heap implementation will not only be balanced, but it will also be **complete**. To clarify, **every complete tree is also a balanced tree**, but not every balanced tree is also complete. Our definition of a complete tree is:

-   a tree where all levels have the maximal number of nodes, except the bottom

    the level

-   AND the bottom level has all nodes filled as far left as possible

Here are few examples of the definition:

![complete\_tree](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/heaps/images/complete_tree.png)

Binary Heap Implementation
--------------------------

Now that we are familiar with the structure of a heap, let's implement one! What may be surprising is that the usual way to implement a heap is by simply using an array. That is, we won't need to create a node class with pointers. Instead, each index of the array will represent a node, with the root being at index 1. We'll avoid using index 0 of the array so our math works out nicely. From this point, we'll use the following rules to interpret the array as a heap:

-   index `i` represents a node in the heap
-   the left child of node `i` can be found at index `2 * i`
-   the right child of code `i` can be found at index `2 * i + 1`

In other words, the array `[null, 42, 32, 24, 30, 9, 20, 18, 2, 7]` represents the heap below. Take a moment to analyze how the array indices work out to represent left and right children.

![max\_heap](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/heaps/images/max_heap.png)

Pretty clever math right? We can also describe the relationship from child to parent node. Say we are given a node at index `i` in the heap, then it's parent is found at index `Math.floor(i / 2)` .

It's useful to visualize heap algorithms using the classic image of nodes and edges, but we'll translate that into array index operations.

### Insert

What's a heap if we can't add data into it? We'll need a `insert` method that will add a new value into the heap without voiding our heap property. In our `MaxHeap` , the property states that a node must be greater than its children.

#### Visualizing our heap as a tree of nodes:

1.  We begin an insertion by adding the new node to the bottom leaf level of the

    heap, preferring to place the new node as far left in the level as possible. This ensures the tree remains complete.

2.  Placing the new node there may momentarily break our heap property, so we

    need to restore it by moving the node up the tree into a legal position. Restoring the heap property is a matter of continually swapping the new node with it's parent while it's parent contains a smaller value. We refer to this process as `siftUp`

#### Translating that into array operations:

1.  `push` the new value to the end of the array
2.  continually swap that value toward the front of the array (following our

    child-parent index rules) until heap property is restored

### DeleteMax

This is the “fetch” operation of a heap. Since we maintain heap property throughout, the root of the heap will always be the maximum value. We want to delete and return the root, whilst keeping the heap property.

#### Visualizing our heap as a tree of nodes:

1.  We begin the deletion by saving a reference to the root value (the max) to

    return later. We then locate the right most node of the bottom level and copy it's value into the root of the tree. We easily delete the duplicate node at the leaf level. This ensures the tree remains complete.

2.  Copying that value into the root may momentarily break our heap property, so

    we need to restore it by moving the node down the tree into a legal position. Restoring the heap property is a matter of continually swapping the node with the greater of it's two children. We refer to this process as `siftDown` .

#### Translating that into array operations:

1.  The root is at index 1, so save it to return later. The right most node of

    the bottom level would just be the very last element of the array. Copy the last element into index 1, and pop off the last element (since it now appears at the root).

2.  Continually swap the new root toward the back of the array (following our

    parent-child index rules) until heap property is restored. A node can have two children, so we should always prefer to swap with the greater child.

### Time Complexity Analysis

-   insert: `O(log(n))`
-   deleteMax: `O(log(n))`

Recall that our heap will be a complete/balanced tree. This means it's height is `log(n)` where `n` is the number of items. Both `insert` and `deleteMax` have a time complexity of `log(n)` because of `siftUp` and `siftDown` respectively. In worst case `insert` , we will have to `siftUp` a leaf all the way to the root of the tree. In the worst case `deleteMax` , we will have to `siftDown` the new root all the way down to the leaf level. In either case, we'll have to traverse the full height of the tree, `log(n)` .

#### Array Heapify Analysis

Now that we have established `O(log(n))` for a single insertion, let's analyze the time complexity for turning an array into a heap (we call this heapify, coming in the next project :)). The algorithm itself is simple, just perform an `insert` for every element. Since there are `n` elements and each insert requires `log(n)` time, our total complexity for heapify is `O(nlog(n))` … Or is it? There is actually a tighter bound on heapify. The proof requires some math that you won't find valuable in your job search, but do understand that the true time complexity of heapify is amortized `O(n)` . Amortized refers to the fact that our analysis is about performance over many insertions.

### Space Complexity Analysis

-   `O(n)`, since we use a single array to store heap data.heap, let's implement one! What

may be surprising is that the usual way to implement a heap is by simply using an array. That is, we won't need to create a node class with pointers. Instead, each index of the array will represent a node, with the root being at index 1. We'll avoid using index 0 of the array so our math works out nicely. From this point, we'll use the following rules to interpret the array as a heap:

-   index `i` represents a node in the heap
-   the left child of node `i` can be found at index `2 * i`
-   the right child of code `i` can be found at index `2 * i + 1`

In other words, the array `[null, 42, 32, 24, 30, 9, 20, 18, 2, 7]` represents the heap below. Take a moment to analyze how the array indices work out to represent left and right children.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heap Sort
---------

We've emphasized heavily that heaps are a *partially ordered* data structure. However, we can still leverage heaps in a sorting algorithm to end up with fully sorted array. The strategy is simple using our previous `MaxHeap` implementation:

1.  build the heap: `insert` all elements of the array into a `MaxHeap`
2.  construct the sorted list: continue to `deleteMax` until the heap is empty, every deletion will return the next element in decreasing order

The code is straightforward:

    code class="language-javascript"// assuming our `MaxHeap` from the previous section

    function heapSort(array) {
        // Step 1: build the heap
        let heap = new MaxHeap();
        array.forEach(num => heap.insert(num));

        // Step 2: constructed the sorted array
        let sorted = [];
        while (heap.array.length > 1) {
            sorted.push(heap.deleteMax());
        }

        return sorted;
    }

### Time Complexity Analysis: O(nlog(n))

-   `n` is the size of the input array
-   step-1 requires `O(n)` time as previously discussed
-   step-2's while loop requires `n` steps in isolation and each `deleteMax` will require `log(n)` steps to restore max heap property (due to sifting-down). This means step 2 costs `O(nlog(n))`
-   the total time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n + nlog(n)) =                 O(nlog(n))`

### Space Complexity Analysis:

So `heapSort` performs as fast as our other efficient sorting algorithms, but how does it fair in space complexity? Our implementation above requires an extra `O(n)` amount of space because the heap is maintained separately from the input array. If we can figure out a way to do all of these heap operations in-place we can get constant `O(1)` space! Let's work on this now.

In-Place Heap Sort
------------------

The in-place algorithm will have the same 2 steps, but it will differ in the implementation details. Since we need to have all operations take place in a single array, we're going to have to denote two regions of the array. That is, we'll need a heap region and a sorted region. We begin by turning the entire region into a heap. Then we continually delete max to get the next element in increasing order. As the heap region shrinks, the sorted region will grow.

### Heapify

Let's focus on designing step-1 as an in-place algorithm. In other words, we'll need to reorder elements of the input array so they follow max heap property. This is usually refered to as `heapify` . Our `heapify` will use much of the same logic as `MaxHeap#siftDown` .

    code class="language-javascript"// swap the elements at indices i and j of array
    function swap(array, i, j) {
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }

    // sift-down the node at index i until max heap property is restored
    // n represents the size of the heap
    function heapify(array, n, i) {
        let leftIdx = 2 * i + 1;
        let rightIdx = 2 * i + 2;

        let leftVal = array[leftIdx];
        let rightVal = array[rightIdx];

        if (leftIdx >= n) leftVal = -Infinity;
        if (rightIdx >= n) rightVal = -Infinity;

        if (array[i] > leftVal && array[i] > rightVal) return;

        let swapIdx;
        if (leftVal < rightVal) {
            swapIdx = rightIdx;
        } else {
            swapIdx = leftIdx;
        }
        swap(array, i, swapIdx);
        heapify(array, n, swapIdx);
    }

We weren't kidding when we said this would be similar to `MaxHeap#siftDown` . If you are not convinced, flip to the previous section and take a look! The few differences we want to emphasize are:

-   Given a node at index `i`, it's left index is `2 * i + 1` and it's right index is `2                 * i                 + 2`
    -   Using these as our child index formulas will allow us to avoid using a placeholder element at index 0. The root of the heap will be at index 0.
-   The parameter `n` represents the number of nodes in the heap
    -   You may feel that `array.length` also represents the number of nodes in the heap. That is true, but only in step-1. Later we will need to dynamically state the size of the heap. Remember, we are trying to do this without creating any extra arrays. We'll need to separate the heap and sorted regions of the array and `n` will dictate the end of the heap.
-   We created a separate `swap` helper function.
    -   Nothing fancy here. Swapping will be valuable in step-2 of the algorithm as well, so we'll want to keep our code DRY (don't repeat yourself).

To correctly convert the input array into a heap, we'll need to call `heapify` on children nodes before their parents. This is easy to do, just call `heapify` on each element right-to-left in the array:

    code class="language-javascript"function heapSort(array) {
        // heapify the tree from the bottom up
        for (let i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            heapify(array, array.length, i);
        }
        // the entire array is now a heap
     // ...
    }

Nice! Now the elements of the array have been moved around to obey max heap property.

### Construct the Sorted Array

To put everything together, we'll need to continually “delete max” from our heap. From our previous lecture, we learned the steps for deletion are to swap the last node of the heap into the root and then sift the new root down to restore max heap property. We'll follow the same logic here, except we'll need to account for the sorted region of the array. The array will contain the heap region in the front and the sorted region at the rear:

    code class="language-javascript"function heapSort(array) {
        // heapify the tree from the bottom up
        for (let i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            heapify(array, array.length, i);
        }
        // the entire array is now a heap

        // until the heap is empty, continue to "delete max"
        for (let endOfHeap = array.length - 1; endOfHeap >= 0; endOfHeap--) {
            // swap the root of the heap with the last element of the heap,
            // this effecively shrinks the heap by one and grows the sorted array by one
            swap(array, endOfHeap, 0);

            // sift down the new root, but not past the end of the heap
            heapify(array, endOfHeap, 0);
        }
        return array;
    }

You'll definitely want to watch the lecture that follows this reading to get a visual of how the array is divided into the heap and sorted regions.

### In-Place Heap Sort JavaScript Implementation

Here is the full code for your reference:

    code class="language-javascript"function heapSort(array) {
        for (let i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            heapify(array, array.length, i);
        }

        for (let endOfHeap = array.length - 1; endOfHeap >= 0; endOfHeap--) {
            swap(array, endOfHeap, 0);
            heapify(array, endOfHeap, 0);
        }

        return array;
    }

    function heapify(array, n, i) {
        let leftIdx = 2 * i + 1;
        let rightIdx = 2 * i + 2;

        let leftVal = array[leftIdx];
        let rightVal = array[rightIdx];

        if (leftIdx >= n) leftVal = -Infinity;
        if (rightIdx >= n) rightVal = -Infinity;

        if (array[i] > leftVal && array[i] > rightVal) return;

        let swapIdx;
        if (leftVal < rightVal) {
            swapIdx = rightIdx;
        } else {
            swapIdx = leftIdx;
        }
        swap(array, i, swapIdx);
        heapify(array, n, swapIdx);
    }

    function swap(array, i, j) {
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }

Heaps Project
=============

This project contains a skeleton for you to implement a max heap. This is a test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If it's not clear what is failing, open the **test/test.js** file to figure out what the test is expecting. Make the top-most test pass.

Keep making the top-most test pass until all tests pass.

Instructions
------------

-   Clone the project from

    https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-max-heap-starter.

-   `cd` into the project folder
-   `npm install` to install dependencies in the project root directory
-   `npm test` to run the specs
-   You can view the test cases in `test/test.js`. Your job is to write code in
    -   **lib/max\_heap.js** to implement the `MaxHeap` class
    -   **lib/is\_heap.js** to implement the `isMaxHeap` function
    -   **lib/leet\_code\_215.js** to implement the `findKthLargest` function located

        at https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

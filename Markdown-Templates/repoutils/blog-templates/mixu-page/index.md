====================================================================================

In the mathematical theory of [directed graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), a graph is said to be **strongly connected** if every vertex is strongly connected components of an arbitrary directed graph form a [partition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition) into subgraphs that are themselves stro ngly connected. It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to fi n d its time.

----------------------------------------------------------

A [directed graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) is called strongly direction between each pair of vertices of the graph. In a directed graph *G* that may not itself be strongly connected, a pair of vertices *u* and *v* are said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a path in each direction between them.

connected is an [equivalence relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation), and the [induced subgraphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_subgraph) of its [equivalence **strongly connected component** of a directed graph *G* is a subgraph that is strongly connected, and is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_subgraph) [maximal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal) with this prop erty: no additional edges or vertices from *G* can be included in the subgraph without for ms a [partition](http://google.com/ "Google") of the set of vertices of *G*.

I f each strongly connected component is [contracted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracted) to a single vertex, the resulting graph is a [directed acyclic graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG), the **condensation** of *G*. A directed graph is acyclic if and only if it has no connected and every nontrivial strongly connected component contains at least one directed cycle.

-   [Kosaraju's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG) uses two passes of [transpose graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG) of the original graph, and each recursive exploration finds a single new strongly connected described it (but did not publish his results) in 1978; [Micha Sharir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG) later published it in 1981.

Although Kosaraju's algorithm is conceptually simple, Tarjan's and the path-based algorithm are favoured in practice since they require only o

<a href="#applications" class="header-link"></a>Applications
------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm s for finding strongly connected components may be used to variables wi th constraints on the values of pairs of variables): as showed, a [2-satisfiability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG) instance is unsatisfiable if and only if there is a variable *v* such that *v* and its complement are both c ontained in

Strongly connected components are also used to compute the [Dulmageâ€“Mendelsohn decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG), a of the edges of a [bipartite graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG), according to whether or not they can be part of a [perfect matching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG)

A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if it has an [ear decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG), a partition of the edges into a sequence of directed paths and cycles such that the first subgraph in the sequence is a cycle, and each subsequent subgraph is either a cycle sharing one vertex with previous subgraphs, or a path

According to [Robbins' theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAG), an undirected graph may be [oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time) in such a way that it becomes strongly connected, if and only if it is

What about some code **in** a list? That's insane, right?

1.  In Ruby you can map like this:

                        In Rails, you can do a shortcut:

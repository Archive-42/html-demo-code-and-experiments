7.0.0 / 2018-07-16
------------------

-   Fix bug with copying write-protected directories ([\#600](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/600))
-   Universalify `fs.lchmod()` ([\#596](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/596))
-   Add `engines` field to `package.json` ([\#580](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/580))

6.0.1 / 2018-05-09
------------------

-   Fix `fs.promises` `ExperimentalWarning` on Node v10.1.0 ([\#578](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/578))

6.0.0 / 2018-05-01
------------------

-   Drop support for Node.js versions 4, 5, & 7 ([\#564](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/564))
-   Rewrite `move` to use `fs.rename` where possible ([\#549](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/549))
-   Don’t convert relative paths to absolute paths for `filter` ([\#554](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/554))
-   `copy*`’s behavior when `preserveTimestamps` is `false` has been OS-dependent since 5.0.0, but that’s now explicitly noted in the docs ([\#563](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/563))
-   Fix subdirectory detection for `copy*` & `move*` ([\#541](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/541))
-   Handle case-insensitive paths correctly in `copy*` ([\#568](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/568))

5.0.0 / 2017-12-11
------------------

Significant refactor of `copy()` & `copySync()`, including breaking changes. No changes to other functions in this release.

Huge thanks to **<span class="citation" data-cites="manidlou">\[@manidlou\]</span>(https://github.com/manidlou)** for doing most of the work on this release.

-   The `filter` option can no longer be a RegExp (must be a function). This was deprecated since fs-extra v1.0.0. [\#512](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/512)
-   `copy()`’s `filter` option can now be a function that returns a Promise. [\#518](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/518)
-   `copy()` & `copySync()` now use `fs.copyFile()`/`fs.copyFileSync()` in environments that support it (currently Node 8.5.0+). Older Node versions still get the old implementation. [\#505](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/505)
-   Don’t allow copying a directory into itself. [\#83](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/83)
-   Handle copying between identical files. [\#198](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/198)
-   Error out when copying an empty folder to a path that already exists. [\#464](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/464)
-   Don’t create `dest`’s parent if the `filter` function aborts the `copy()` operation. [\#517](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/517)
-   Fix `writeStream` not being closed if there was an error in `copy()`. [\#516](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/516)

4.0.3 / 2017-12-05
------------------

-   Fix wrong `chmod` values in `fs.remove()` [\#501](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501)
-   Fix `TypeError` on systems that don’t have some `fs` operations like `lchown` [\#520](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520)

4.0.2 / 2017-09-12
------------------

-   Added `EOL` option to `writeJson*` & `outputJson*` (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)
-   Added promise support to [`fs.copyFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback) in Node 8.5+
-   Added `.js` extension to `main` field in `package.json` for better tooling compatibility. [\#485](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485)

4.0.1 / 2017-07-31
------------------

### Fixed

-   Previously, `ensureFile()` & `ensureFileSync()` would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with `ensureDir()`. [\#465](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465), [\#466](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466), [\#470](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470)

4.0.0 / 2017-07-14
------------------

### Changed

-   **BREAKING:** The promisified versions of `fs.read()` & `fs.write()` now return objects. See [the docs](docs/fs-read-write.md) for details. [\#436](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436), [\#449](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449)
-   `fs.move()` now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. [\#458](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458)
-   Applied upstream fixes from `rimraf` to `fs.remove()` & `fs.removeSync()`. [\#459](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459)

### Fixed

-   Got `fs.outputJSONSync()` working again; it was broken due to refactoring. [\#428](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428)

Also clarified the docs in a few places.

3.0.1 / 2017-05-04
------------------

-   Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [\#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)

3.0.0 / 2017-04-27
------------------

### Added

-   **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [\#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)
-   `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [\#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)

### Removed

-   **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [\#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)

### Changed

-   Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:
    -   **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.
-   **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [\#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)
-   Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [\#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)

### Fixed

-   `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [\#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)

2.1.2 / 2017-03-16
------------------

### Fixed

-   Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`’s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [\#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [\#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)

2.1.1 / 2017-03-15
------------------

### Fixed

-   Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.
-   Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.

2.1.0 / 2017-03-15
------------------

Thanks to <span class="citation" data-cites="manidlou">\[Mani Maghsoudlou (@manidlou)\]</span>(https://github.com/manidlou) & <span class="citation" data-cites="JPeer264">\[Jan Peer Stöcklmair (@JPeer264)\]</span>(https://github.com/JPeer264) for their extraordinary help with this release!

### Added

-   `moveSync()` See [\#309](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/309 "moveSync support [enhancement, feature-move]"), [\#381](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/381). (<span class="citation" data-cites="manidlou">\[@manidlou\]</span>(https://github.com/manidlou))
-   `copy()` and `copySync()`’s `filter` option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. [\#366](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366) (<span class="citation" data-cites="manidlou">\[@manidlou\]</span>(https://github.com/manidlou))

### Changed

-   Use `Buffer.alloc()` instead of deprecated `new Buffer()` in `copySync()`. [\#380](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380) (<span class="citation" data-cites="manidlou">\[@manidlou\]</span>(https://github.com/manidlou))
-   Refactored entire codebase to use ES6 features supported by Node.js v4+ [\#355](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355). <span class="citation" data-cites="JPeer264">\[(@JPeer264)\]</span>(https://github.com/JPeer264)
-   Refactored docs. (<span class="citation" data-cites="manidlou">\[@manidlou\]</span>(https://github.com/manidlou))

### Fixed

-   `move()` shouldn’t error out when source and dest are the same. [\#377](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/377), [\#378](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/378) (<span class="citation" data-cites="jdalton">\[@jdalton\]</span>(https://github.com/jdalton))

2.0.0 / 2017-01-16
------------------

### Removed

-   **BREAKING:** Removed support for Node `v0.12`. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it on Jan 1st, 2017.
-   **BREAKING:** Remove `walk()` and `walkSync()`. `walkSync()` was only part of `fs-extra` for a little over two months. Use [klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) instead of `walk()`, in fact, `walk()` was just an alias to klaw. For `walkSync()` use [klaw-sync](https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync). See: [\#338](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/338 "Remove walk() and walkSync() [feature-walk]"), [\#339](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/339 "Remove walk() & walkSync() [feature-walk]")

### Changed

-   **BREAKING:** Renamed `clobber` to `overwrite`. This affects `copy()`, `copySync()`, and `move()`. [\#330](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/330 "BREAKING: Do not error when copy destination exists & clobber: false [feature-copy]"), [\#333](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/333 "Rename clobber to overwrite [feature-copy, feature-move]")
-   Moved docs, to `docs/`. [\#340](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/340 "Move docs to seperate docs folder [documentation]")

### Fixed

-   Apply filters to directories in `copySync()` like in `copy()`. [\#324](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/324 "copySync() should apply filter to directories like copy() [bug, feature-copy]")
-   A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, `copy()` can fail. [\#326](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/326 "fs.copy fails with chmod error when disk under heavy use [bug, feature-copy]")

1.0.0 / 2016-11-01
------------------

After five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes to [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!

### Added

-   `walkSync()`

### Changed

-   **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.
-   disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn’t used. [\#280](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/280 "Disable rimraf globbing")
-   deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it’s a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.
-   inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [\#300](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/300 "Inline Rimraf [enhancement, feature-move, feature-remove]")

### Fixed

-   bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [\#271](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/271 "Unclosed file handle on futimes error")
-   proper escaping of files with dollar signs [\#291](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/291 "Escape '$' in replacement string for async file copying")
-   `copySync()` failed if user didn’t own file. [\#199](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/199 "fs.copySync fails if user does not own file [bug, feature-copy]"), [\#301](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/301 "Remove chmod call from copySync [feature-copy]")

0.30.0 / 2016-04-28
-------------------

-   Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn’t realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.

0.29.0 / 2016-04-27
-------------------

-   **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.

0.28.0 / 2016-04-17
-------------------

-   **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [\#192](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/192 "Remove fs.createOutputStream()")
-   `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [\#209](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/209 "In Windows invalid directory name causes infinite loop in ensureDir(). [bug]"), [\#237](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/237 ".ensureDir(..) fails silently when passed an invalid path...")
-   `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: \[\#93\]\[\#93\]

0.27.0 / 2016-04-15
-------------------

-   add `dereference` option to `copySync()`. [\#235](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/235 "Adds symlink dereference option to `fse.copySync` (#191)")

0.26.7 / 2016-03-16
-------------------

-   fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [\#230](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/230 "throw error if src and dest are the same to avoid zeroing out + test")

0.26.6 / 2016-03-15
-------------------

-   fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [\#229](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/229 "fix 'TypeError: callback is not a function' in emptyDir")

0.26.5 / 2016-01-27
-------------------

-   `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [\#215](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/215 "fse.copy throws error when only src and dest provided [bug, documentation, feature-copy]")

0.26.4 / 2016-01-05
-------------------

-   `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [\#208](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/208 "fix options.preserveTimestamps to false in copy-sync by default [feature-copy]")

0.26.3 / 2015-12-17
-------------------

-   fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blockDevice / characterDevice / `/dev/null`. See: [\#193](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/193 "`fs.copy` fails silently if source file is /dev/null [bug, feature-copy]")

0.26.2 / 2015-11-02
-------------------

-   fixed `outputJson{Sync}()` spacing adherence to `fs.spaces`

0.26.1 / 2015-11-02
-------------------

-   fixed `copySync()` when `clogger=true` and the destination is read only. See: [\#190](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/190 "copySync to overwrite destination file if readonly and clobber true")

0.26.0 / 2015-10-25
-------------------

-   extracted the `walk()` function into its own module [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw).

0.25.0 / 2015-10-24
-------------------

-   now has a file walker `walk()`

0.24.0 / 2015-08-28
-------------------

-   removed alias `delete()` and `deleteSync()`. See: [\#171](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/171 "remove unnecessary aliases")

0.23.1 / 2015-08-07
-------------------

-   Better handling of errors for `move()` when moving across devices. [\#170](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/170 "More robust handling of errors moving across virtual drives")
-   `ensureSymlink()` and `ensureLink()` should not throw errors if link exists. [\#169](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/169 "suppress ensureLink & ensureSymlink dest exists error")

0.23.0 / 2015-08-06
-------------------

-   added `ensureLink{Sync}()` and `ensureSymlink{Sync}()`. See: [\#165](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/165 "ensure for link & symlink")

0.22.1 / 2015-07-09
-------------------

-   Prevent calling `hasMillisResSync()` on module load. See: [\#149](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/149 "/tmp/millis-test-sync"). Fixes regression that was introduced in `0.21.0`.

0.22.0 / 2015-07-09
-------------------

-   preserve permissions / ownership in `copy()`. See: \[\#54\]\[\#54\]

0.21.0 / 2015-07-04
-------------------

-   add option to preserve timestamps in `copy()` and `copySync()`. See: [\#141](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/141 "Add option to preserve timestamps")
-   updated `graceful-fs@3.x` to `4.x`. This brings in features from `amazing-graceful-fs` (much cleaner code / less hacks)

0.20.1 / 2015-06-23
-------------------

-   fixed regression caused by latest jsonfile update: See: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/issues/26

0.20.0 / 2015-06-19
-------------------

-   removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren’t documented and probably weren’t in use e.g. this package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.
-   preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.
-   started moving tests inline
-   upgraded to `jsonfile@2.1.0`, can now pass JSON revivers/replacers to `readJson()`, `writeJson()`, `outputJson()`

0.19.0 / 2015-06-08
-------------------

-   `fs.copy()` had support for Node v0.8, dropped support

0.18.4 / 2015-05-22
-------------------

-   fixed license field according to this: [\#136](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/136 "Update license attribute") and https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v2.10.0

0.18.3 / 2015-05-08
-------------------

-   bugfix: handle `EEXIST` when clobbering on some Linux systems. [\#134](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/134 "Handle EEXIST error when clobbering dir")

0.18.2 / 2015-04-17
-------------------

-   bugfix: allow `F_OK` (\[\#120\]\[\#120\])

0.18.1 / 2015-04-15
-------------------

-   improved windows support for `move()` a bit. https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/92838980f25dc2ee4ec46b43ee14d3c4a1d30c1b
-   fixed a lot of tests for Windows (appveyor)

0.18.0 / 2015-03-31
-------------------

-   added `emptyDir()` and `emptyDirSync()`

0.17.0 / 2015-03-28
-------------------

-   `copySync` added `clobber` option (before always would clobber, now if `clobber` is `false` it throws an error if the destination exists). **Only works with files at the moment.**
-   `createOutputStream()` added. See: \[\#118\]\[\#118\]

0.16.5 / 2015-03-08
-------------------

-   fixed `fs.move` when `clobber` is `true` and destination is a directory, it should clobber. \[\#114\]\[\#114\]

0.16.4 / 2015-03-01
-------------------

-   `fs.mkdirs` fix infinite loop on Windows. See: See https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/pull/74 and https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp/issues/66

0.16.3 / 2015-01-28
-------------------

-   reverted https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/1ee77c8a805eba5b99382a2591ff99667847c9c9

0.16.2 / 2015-01-28
-------------------

-   fixed `fs.copy` for Node v0.8 (support is temporary and will be removed in the near future)

0.16.1 / 2015-01-28
-------------------

-   if `setImmediate` is not available, fall back to `process.nextTick`

0.16.0 / 2015-01-28
-------------------

-   bugfix `fs.move()` into itself. Closes \[\#104\]
-   bugfix `fs.move()` moving directory across device. Closes \[\#108\]
-   added coveralls support
-   bugfix: nasty multiple callback `fs.copy()` bug. Closes \[\#98\]
-   misc fs.copy code cleanups

0.15.0 / 2015-01-21
-------------------

-   dropped `ncp`, imported code in
-   because of previous, now supports `io.js`
-   `graceful-fs` is now a dependency

0.14.0 / 2015-01-05
-------------------

-   changed `copy`/`copySync` from `fs.copy(src, dest, [filters], callback)` to `fs.copy(src, dest, [options], callback)` \[\#100\]\[\#100\]
-   removed mockfs tests for mkdirp (this may be temporary, but was getting in the way of other tests)

0.13.0 / 2014-12-10
-------------------

-   removed `touch` and `touchSync` methods (they didn’t handle permissions like UNIX touch)
-   updated `"ncp": "^0.6.0"` to `"ncp": "^1.0.1"`
-   imported `mkdirp` =&gt; `minimist` and `mkdirp` are no longer dependences, should now appease people who wanted `mkdirp` to be `--use_strict` safe. See [\#59](%5B#59%5D%5B#59%5D)

0.12.0 / 2014-09-22
-------------------

-   copy symlinks in `copySync()` \[\#85\]\[\#85\]

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/noop2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.org/package/noop2) [![build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/yoshuawuyts/noop2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/yoshuawuyts/noop2) [![Test coverage](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/yoshuawuyts/noop2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://coveralls.io/r/yoshuawuyts/noop2?branch=master) [![Downloads](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/noop2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.org/package/noop2)

No operation as a module™. The long awaited successor to [`noop`](http://ghub.io/noop). Noop2 does even less than its predecessor, and is 100% tested to guarantee nothing happens.

Installation
------------

    npm install noop2

Usage
-----

    var noop = require('noop2');

    noop();
    // nothing happened

Why?
----

This is both a joke and actually useful. Obviously we *might* be taking npm a bit too far by bundling this as a module, but when running tests it’s sometimes nice to be able to import an empty function if only to keep style consistent. So here you have it.

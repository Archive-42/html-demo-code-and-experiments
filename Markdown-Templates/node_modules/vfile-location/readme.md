Convert between positional (line and column-based) and offsets (range-based) locations in a [virtual file](https://github.com/vfile/vfile).

Install
-------

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

    npm install vfile-location

Use
---

    var vfile = require('vfile')
    var vfileLocation = require('vfile-location')

    var location = vfileLocation(vfile('foo\nbar\nbaz'))

    var offset = location.toOffset({line: 3, column: 3}) // => 10
    location.toPoint(offset) // => {line: 3, column: 3, offset: 10}

API
---

### `location = vfileLocation(doc)`

Get transform functions for the given `doc` (`string`) or [`file`](https://github.com/vfile/vfile).

Returns an object with [`toOffset`](#locationtooffsetpoint) and [`toPoint`](#locationtopointoffset).

### `location.toOffset(point)`

Get the `offset` (`number`) for a line and column-based [`point`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#point) in the bound file. Returns `-1` when given invalid or out of bounds input.

### `location.toPoint(offset)`

Get the line and column-based [`point`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#point) for `offset` in the bound file.

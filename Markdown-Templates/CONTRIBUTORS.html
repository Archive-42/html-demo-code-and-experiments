      <p>
        This is maybe the most important file of your project if you think about
        maintanability and long-term support. It recognizes people who are
        helping you and, directly or indirectly, baking your/your project
        success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those people spend their time, for free, to make your project better.
        You should, by all means, praise and thank them whenever you want. Time
        is an asset that never comes back, so if people choose to use their time
        with your code, this file shows them the respect they want.

        Here you should include a list of people who helped your project. A good
        practice would be their names and GH profiles. Other additional info may
        fit, but names and profiles are mandatory. Proper credits matter.

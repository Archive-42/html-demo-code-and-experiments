      <p>
        On the first paragraph, take some lines to thank your future
        contributors. It motivates people and makes you more human.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Expose your project guidelines about how to contribute to it. Offer
        resources that people could use to discuss changes they wish to make,
        ask questions and talk about how they could help (and what needs their
        help).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>ProTip:</strong> It’s important people know the rules for
        contributing in the project. It’s irritating for people trying to help
        when they are pushed back because they didn’t follow some process that
        they didn’t know existed. This file is the place for these processes and
        it will lower the barrier to entry for contribution.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This section should explicitly state that we will not discriminate
        against people on any grounds other than their code contributions, and
        make clear that behaviour that would be harmful to other people that may
        wish to contribute is not acceptable. This gives clear authority to
        remove people who are causing problems, and also sets a clear tone of
        inclusion.

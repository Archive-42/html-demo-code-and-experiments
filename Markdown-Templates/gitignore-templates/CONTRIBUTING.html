    <p>
      We’d love you to help us improve this project. To help us keep this
      collection high quality, we request that contributions adhere to the
      following guidelines.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Provide a link to the application or project’s homepage</strong
          >. Unless it’s extremely popular, there’s a chance the maintainers
          don’t know about or use the language, framework, editor, app, or
          project your change applies to.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Provide links to documentation</strong> supporting the change
          you’re making. Current, canonical documentation mentioning the files
          being ignored is best. If documentation isn’t available to support
          your change, do the best you can to explain what the files being
          ignored are for.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Explain why you’re making a change</strong>. Even if it seems
          self-evident, please take a sentence or two to tell us why your change
          or addition should happen. It’s especially helpful to articulate why
          this change applies to <em>everyone</em> who works with the applicable
          technology, rather than just you or your team.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Please consider the scope of your change</strong>. If your
          change specific to a certain language or framework, then make sure the
          change is made to the template for that language or framework, rather
          than to the template for an editor, tool, or operating system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Please only modify <em>one template</em> per pull request</strong
          >. This helps keep pull requests and feedback focused on a specific
          project or technology.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change you’re
      making, the more likely we’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a template is mostly a list of files installed by a particular version
      of some software (e.g. a PHP framework) then it’s brittle and probably no
      more helpful than a simple <code>ls</code>. If it’s not possible to curate
      a small set of useful rules, then the template might not be a good fit for
      this collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please also understand that we can’t list every tool that ever existed.
      Our aim is to curate a collection of the
      <em>most common and helpful</em> templates, not to make sure we cover
      every project possible. If we choose not to include your language, tool,
      or project, it’s not because it’s not awesome.

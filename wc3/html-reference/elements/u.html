  <h4>The u element</h4>
  <div id="shortdesc" class="changed">offset text conventionally styled with an underline</div>
  <div id="longdesc">
    <p>The
    <span class="element">u</span>
    element represents a span of text offset from its surrounding content
    without conveying any extra emphasis or importance, and for which the
    conventional typographic presentation is underlining; for example, a
    span of text in Chinese that is a proper name (a Chinese proper name
    mark), or span of text that is known to be misspelled.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="changes">
    <p>Although previous versions of HTML defined the
    <span class="element">u</span>
    element only in presentational terms, the element has now been given
    the specific semantic purpose of representing text “offset from its
    surrounding content without conveying any extra emphasis or importance,
    and for which the conventional typographic presentation is underlining”.</p>

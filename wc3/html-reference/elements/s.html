    <p>The

    element represents contents that are no longer accurate or no longer
    relevant and that therefore has been “struck” from the document.</p>

    <p>Although previous versions of HTML defined the
    <span class="element">s</span>
    element only in presentational terms, the element has now been given
    the specific semantic purpose of representing contents that are no
    longer accurate or no longer relevant.</p>

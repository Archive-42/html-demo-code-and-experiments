  <div id="longdesc">
    <p>The
    <span class="element">i</span>
    element represents a
    span of text offset from its surrounding content without
    conveying any extra emphasis or importance, and for which the
    conventional typographic presentation is italic text; for
    example, a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an
    idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship
    name.</p>

  <div id="changes">
    <p>Although previous versions of HTML defined the
    <span class="element">i</span>
    element only in presentational terms, the element has now been
    given the specific semantic purpose of representing text
    “offset from its surrounding content without conveying any
    extra emphasis or importance, and for which the conventional
    typographic presentation is italic text”.</p>

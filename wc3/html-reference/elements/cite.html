    <p>The
    <span class="element">cite</span>
    element represents the cited title of a work; for example, the
    title of a book mentioned within the main text flow of a
    document.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="changes">
    <p>Although previous versions of HTML implied that the
    <span class="element">cite</span>
    element can be used to mark up the name of a person, that
    usage is no longer considered conforming. The
    <span class="element">cite</span>
    element now solely represents the cited title of a work; for
    example, the title of a book, paper, essay, poem, score, song,
    script, film, TV show, game, sculpture, painting, theater
    production, play, opera, musical, exhibition, legal case
    report, or other such work.</p>

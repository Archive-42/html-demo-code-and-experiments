<zcorpan_> MikeSmith: the example on CDATA section doesn't need a
  CDATA section -- it doesn't contain any < or &
<MikeSmith> zcorpan_: yeah, I know. but I copied that straight
  from the MathML spec.. that's the example they have in there. Not
  sure why they're using that as an example
<MikeSmith> maybe I can revise it to add a < or & into it?
<zcorpan_> if it would make sense, otherwise perhaps come up with
  some other example :) also show an equivalent example that uses
  entities instead

- Add a Usage section, with links to tutorials elsewhere.

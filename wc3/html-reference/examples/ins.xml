   <p>The following represents the addition of a single paragraph:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<aside>
 <ins>
  <p> I like fruit. </p>
 </ins>
</aside>]]></pre>

   <p>As does this, because everything in the <code><a href="#the-aside-element">aside</a></code>
   element here counts as <a href="#phrasing-content-0">phrasing content</a> and therefore
   there is just one <a href="#paragraph">paragraph</a>:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<aside>
 <ins>
  Apples are <em>tasty</em>.
 </ins>
 <ins>
  So are pears.
 </ins>
</aside>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>The following example represents the addition of two paragraphs,
   the second of which was inserted in two parts. The first
   <code><a href="#the-ins-element">ins</a></code> element in this example thus crosses a paragraph
   boundary, which is considered poor form.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<aside>
 <ins datetime="2005-03-16T00:00Z">
  <p> I like fruit. </p>
  Apples are <em>tasty</em>.
 </ins>
 <ins datetime="2007-12-19T00:00Z">
  So are pears.
 </ins>
</aside>]]></pre>

   <p>Here is a better way of marking this up. It uses more elements,
   but none of the elements cross implied paragraph boundaries.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<aside>
 <ins datetime="2005-03-16T00:00Z">
  <p> I like fruit. </p>
 </ins>
 <ins datetime="2005-03-16T00:00Z">
  Apples are <em>tasty</em>.
 </ins>
 <ins datetime="2007-12-19T00:00Z">
  So are pears.
 </ins>
</aside>]]></pre>

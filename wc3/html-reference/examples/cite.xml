   <p>This next example shows a typical use of the <code><a href="#the-cite-element">cite</a></code>
   element:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>My favourite book is <cite>The Reality Dysfunction</cite> by
Peter F. Hamilton. My favourite comic is <cite>Pearls Before
Swine</cite> by Stephan Pastis. My favourite track is <cite>Jive
Samba</cite> by the Cannonball Adderley Sextet.</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>This is correct usage:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>According to the Wikipedia article <cite>HTML</cite>, as it
stood in mid-February 2008, leaving attribute values unquoted is
unsafe. This is obviously an over-simplification.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>The following, however, is incorrect usage, as the
   <code><a href="#the-cite-element">cite</a></code> element here is containing far more than the
   title of the work:</p>

   <pre class="bad"><!-- do not copy this example, it is an example of bad usage! -->
<p>According to <cite>the Wikipedia article on HTML</cite>, as it
stood in mid-February 2008, leaving attribute values unquoted is
unsafe. This is obviously an over-simplification.</p>]]></pre>

<div class="example">

   <p>The <code><a href="#the-cite-element">cite</a></code> element is obviously a key part of any
   citation in a bibliography, but it is only used to mark the
   title:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><cite>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</cite>, United Nations,
December 1948.  Adopted by General Assembly resolution 217 A (III).</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>This is incorrect usage, because <code><a href="#the-cite-element">cite</a></code> is not for
   quotes:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><cite>This is wrong!</cite>, said Ian.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>This is also incorrect usage, because a person is not a
   work:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><q>This is still wrong!</q>, said <cite>Ian</cite>.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>The correct usage does not use a <code><a href="#the-cite-element">cite</a></code> element:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><q>This is correct</q>, said Ian.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>As mentioned above, the <code><a href="#the-b-element">b</a></code> element might be relevant
   for marking names as being keywords in certain kinds of
   documents:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>And then <b>Ian</b> said <q>this might be right, in a
gossip column, maybe!</q>.</p>]]></pre>

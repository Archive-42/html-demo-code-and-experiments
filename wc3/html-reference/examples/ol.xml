   <p>The following markup shows a list where the order matters, and
   where the <code><a href="#the-ol-element">ol</a></code> element is therefore appropriate. Compare
   this list to the equivalent list in the <code><a href="#the-ul-element">ul</a></code> section to
   see an example of the same items using the <code><a href="#the-ul-element">ul</a></code>
   element.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>I have lived in the following countries (given in the order of when
I first lived there):</p>
<ol>
 <li>Switzerland
 <li>United Kingdom
 <li>United States
 <li>Norway
</ol>]]></pre>

   <p>Note how changing the order of the list changes the meaning of
   the document. In the following example, changing the relative order
   of the first two items has changed the birthplace of the
   author:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>I have lived in the following countries (given in the order of when
I first lived there):</p>
<ol>
 <li>United Kingdom
 <li>Switzerland
 <li>United States
 <li>Norway
</ol>]]></pre>

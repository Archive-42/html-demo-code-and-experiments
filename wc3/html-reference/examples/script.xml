   <p>In this example, two <code><a href="#script">script</a></code> elements are used. One
   embeds an external script, and the other includes some data.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<script src="game-engine.js"></script>
<script type="text/x-game-map">
........U.........e
o............A....e
.....A.....AAA....e
.A..AAA...AAAAA...e
</script>]]></pre>

   <p>The data in this case might be used by the script to generate
   the map of a video game. The data doesn't have to be used that way,
   though; maybe the map data is actually embedded in other parts of
   the page's markup, and the data block here is just used by the
   site's search engine to help users who are looking for particular
   features in their game maps.</p>

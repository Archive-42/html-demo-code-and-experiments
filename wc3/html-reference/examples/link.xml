   <p>If a document contains style sheet links labeled as follows:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<link rel="stylesheet" href="A" type="text/plain">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="B" type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="C">]]></pre>

   <p>...then a compliant UA that supported only CSS style sheets
   would fetch the B and C files, and skip the A file (since
   <code>text/plain</code> is not the MIME type for CSS style
   sheets).</p>

   <p>For files B and C, it would then check the actual types returned
   by the server. For those that are sent as <code>text/css</code>, it
   would apply the styles, but for those labeled as
   <code>text/plain</code>, or any other type, it would not.</p>

   <p>If one the two files was returned without a
   <a href="#content-type-0">Content-Type</a> metadata, or with a syntactically
   incorrect type like <code title="">Content-Type:Â "null"</code>, then the default type
   for <code title="rel-stylesheet"><a href="#link-type-stylesheet">stylesheet</a></code> links would kick
   in. Since that default type is <code title="">text/css</code>, the
   style sheet <em>would</em> nonetheless be applied.</p>

   <p>This example shows how the <code><a href="#the-mark-element">mark</a></code> example can be used
   to bring attention to a particular part of a quotation:</p>
   <pre><![CDATA[<p lang="en-US">Consider the following quote:</p>
<blockquote lang="en-GB">
 <p>Look around and you will find, no-one's really
 <mark>colour</mark> blind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p lang="en-US">As we can tell from the <em>spelling</em> of the word,
the person writing this quote is clearly not American.</p>]]></pre>
  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>Another example of the <code><a href="#the-mark-element">mark</a></code> element is highlighting
   parts of a document that are matching some search string. If
   someone looked at a document, and the server knew that the user was
   searching for the word "kitten", then the server might return the
   document with one paragraph modified as follows:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>I also have some <mark>kitten</mark>s who are visiting me
these days. They're really cute. I think they like my garden! Maybe I
should adopt a <mark>kitten</mark>.</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>In the following snippet, a paragraph of text refers to a
   specific part of a code fragment.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>The highlighted part below is where the error lies:</p>
<pre><code>var i: Integer;
begin
   i := <mark>1.1</mark>;
end.</code></pre>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>This is another example showing the use of <code><a href="#the-mark-element">mark</a></code> to
   highlight a part of quoted text that was originally not
   emphasised. In this example, common typographic conventions have
   led the author to explicitly style <code><a href="#the-mark-element">mark</a></code> elements in
   quotes to render in italics.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<article>
 <style>
  blockquote mark, q mark {
    font: inherit; font-style: italic;
    text-decoration: none;
    background: transparent; color: inherit;
  }
  .bubble em {
    font: inherit; font-size: larger;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
 </style>
 <h1>She knew</h1>
 <p>Did you notice the subtle joke in the joke on panel 4?</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="bubble">I didn't <em>want</em> to believe. <mark>Of course
  on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack.</mark> But I
  couldn't admit it until I saw for myself.</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>(Emphasis mine.) I thought that was great. It's so pedantic, yet it
 explains everything neatly.</p>
</article>]]></pre>

   <p>Note, incidentally, the distinction between the <code><a href="#the-em-element">em</a></code>
   element in this example, which is part of the original text being
   quoted, and the <code><a href="#the-mark-element">mark</a></code> element, which is highlighting a
   part for comment.</p>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>The following example shows the difference between denoting the
   <em>importance</em> of a span of text (<code><a href="#the-strong-element">strong</a></code>) as
   opposed to denoting the <em>relevance</em> of a span of text
   (<code><a href="#the-mark-element">mark</a></code>). It is an extract from a textbook, where the
   extract has had the parts relevant to the exam highlighted. The
   safety warnings, important though they may be, are apparently not
   relevant to the exam.</p>

<p><mark>A wormhole in normal conditions can be held open for a
maximum of just under 39 minutes.</mark> Conditions that can increase
the time include a powerful energy source coupled to one or both of
the gates connecting the wormhole, and a large gravity well (such as a
black hole).</p>

<p><mark>Momentum is preserved across the wormhole. Electromagnetic
radiation can travel in both directions through a wormhole,
but matter cannot.</mark></p>

<p>When a wormhole is created, a vortex normally forms.
<strong>Warning: The vortex caused by the wormhole opening will
annihilate anything in its path.</strong> Vortexes can be avoided when
using sufficiently advanced dialing technology.</p>

<p><mark>An obstruction in a gate will prevent it from accepting a
wormhole connection.</mark></p>]]></pre>

   <p>The following example shows a use of the <code><a href="#the-b-element">b</a></code> element
   to highlight key words without marking them up as important:</p>
   <pre><![CDATA[<p>The <b>frobonitor</b> and <b>barbinator</b> components are fried.</p>]]></pre>
  </div>
<div class="example">
   <p>In the following example, objects in a text adventure are
   highlighted as being special by use of the <code><a href="#the-b-element">b</a></code>
   element.</p>
   <pre><![CDATA[<p>You enter a small room. Your <b>sword</b> glows
brighter. A <b>rat</b> scurries past the corner wall.</p>]]></pre>
  </div>
<div class="example">
   <p>Another case where the <code><a href="#the-b-element">b</a></code> element is appropriate is
   in marking up the lede (or lead) sentence or paragraph. The
   following example shows how a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/north_east/7101506.stm">BBC
   article about kittens adopting a rabbit as their own</a> could be
   marked up using HTML5 elements:</p>
   <pre><![CDATA[<article>
 <h2>Kittens 'adopted' by pet rabbit</h2>
 <p><b>Six abandoned kittens have found an unexpected new
 mother figure â€” a pet rabbit.</b></p>
 <p>Veterinary nurse Melanie Humble took the three-week-old
 kittens to her Aberdeen home.</p>
<i>[...]</i>]]></pre>
  </div>
<div class="example">
   <p>The following would be <em>incorrect</em> usage:</p>
   <pre><![CDATA[<p><b>WARNING!</b> Do not frob the barbinator!</p>]]></pre>
   <p>In the previous example, the correct element to use would have
   been <code><a href="#the-strong-element">strong</a></code>, not <code><a href="#the-b-element">b</a></code>.</p>

   <p>Here is a simple example of the use of the <code><a href="#the-q-element">q</a></code>
   element:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>The man said <q>Things that are impossible just take
longer</q>. I disagreed with him.</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>Here is an example with both an explicit citation link in the
   <code><a href="#the-q-element">q</a></code> element, and an explicit citation outside:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>The W3C page <cite>About W3C</cite> says the W3C's
mission is <q cite="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">To lead the
World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and
guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web</q>. I
disagree with this mission.</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, the quotation itself contains a
   quotation:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>In <cite>Example One</cite>, he writes <q>The man
said <q>Things that are impossible just take longer</q>. I
disagreed with him</q>. Well, I disagree even more!</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, quotation marks are used instead of
   the <code><a href="#the-q-element">q</a></code> element:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>His best argument was ❝I disagree❞, which
I thought was laughable.</p>]]></pre>

  </div>
<div class="example">

   <p>In the following example, there is no quote — the
   quotation marks are used to name a word. Use of the <code><a href="#the-q-element">q</a></code>
   element in this case would be inappropriate.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>The word "ineffable" could have been used to describe the disaster
resulting from the campaign's mismanagement.</p>]]></pre>

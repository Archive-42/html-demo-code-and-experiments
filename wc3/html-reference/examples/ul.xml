   <p>The following markup shows a list where the order does not
   matter, and where the <code><a href="#the-ul-element">ul</a></code> element is therefore
   appropriate. Compare this list to the equivalent list in the
   <code><a href="#the-ol-element">ol</a></code> section to see an example of the same items using
   the <code><a href="#the-ol-element">ol</a></code> element.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Norway
 <li>Switzerland
 <li>United Kingdom
 <li>United States

   <p>Note that changing the order of the list does not change the
   meaning of the document. The items in the snippet above are given
   in alphabetical order, but in the snippet below they are given in
   order of the size of their current account balance in 2007, without
   changing the meaning of the document whatsoever:</p>

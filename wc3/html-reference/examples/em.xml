   <p>These examples show how changing the emphasis changes the
   meaning. First, a general statement of fact, with no emphasis:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>Cats are cute animals.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>By emphasizing the first word, the statement implies that the
   kind of animal under discussion is in question (maybe someone is
   asserting that dogs are cute):</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><em>Cats</em> are cute animals.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>Moving the emphasis to the verb, one highlights that the truth
   of the entire sentence is in question (maybe someone is saying cats
   are not cute):</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>Cats <em>are</em> cute animals.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>By moving it to the adjective, the exact nature of the cats
   is reasserted (maybe someone suggested cats were <em>mean</em>
   animals):</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>Cats are <em>cute</em> animals.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>Similarly, if someone asserted that cats were vegetables,
   someone correcting this might emphasize the last word:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p>Cats are cute <em>animals</em>.</p>]]></pre>

   <p>By emphasizing the entire sentence, it becomes clear that the
   speaker is fighting hard to get the point across. This kind of
   emphasis also typically affects the punctuation, hence the
   exclamation mark here.</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><em>Cats are cute animals!</em></p>]]></pre>

   <p>Anger mixed with emphasizing the cuteness could lead to markup
   such as:</p>

   <pre><![CDATA[<p><em>Cats are <em>cute</em> animals!</em></p>]]></pre>

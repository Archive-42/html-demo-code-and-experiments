    <p>This document is a working draft â€” all parts of it remain
    subject to significant change or removal, and some parts are
    currently incomplete; in particular, many elements currently
    lack complete documentation in the following subsections:</p>
    <dl class="status-missing">
      <dt><span class="section-title-ref">Examples</span></dt>
      <dd>The documentation for each element ideally have
        at least one conformant example and at least one
        non-conformant example.</dd>
      <dt><span class="section-title-ref">Details</span></dt>
      <dd>The purpose of this subsection is to provide, where
        needed, additional details about the semantics of the
        element and its attributes.</dd>
      <dt><span class="section-title-ref">Additional constraints and admonitions</span></dt>
      <dd>This purpose of this subsection is to provide, where
        needed, additional document-conformance constraints and
        usage admonitions for the element and its attributes (in
        addition to those already documented in the
        <i>Permitted content</i>,
        <i>Permitted attributes</i>,
        <i>Permitted parent elements</i>,
        and
        <i>Tag omission</i>
        subsections).</dd>

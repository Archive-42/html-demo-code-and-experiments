  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This document is a non-normative reference that provides
  details to help
  <a href="#html-producer">producers of HTML content</a>
  create
  <a href="#conformant-documents">conformant documents</a>,
  and to help others check the conformance of existing documents.
  It has the following design goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to describe the syntax and structure of the
    <a href="#html-language">HTML language</a></li>
    <li>to describe the semantics of
    <a href="#html-elements">HTML elements</a>
    and their attributes (that is, to describe what the elements
    and attributes represent)</li>
    <li>to be clear and unambiguous</li>
    <li>to be as concise and readable as possible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first two of the above design goals make this reference
  similar in scope to the 
  <a href="#refsHTML5ForWebAuthors">[HTML5 for Web Authors]</a>
  subset of the normative
  <a href="#refsHTML5">[HTML5]</a>
  full specification.</p>
  <p>Certain purposes are intentionally out of scope for this
  reference document; specifically, it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>does not provide any descriptions of implementation
    conformance criteria for
    <a href="#html-consumer">HTML consumers</a>;
    in particular, it does not attempt to explain how Web browsers
    and other user agents are meant to process documents</li>
    <li>does not provide detailed information on APIs related to
    processing of HTML content by
    <a href="#html-consumer">HTML consumers</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For implementation conformance criteria for
    <a href="#html-consumer">HTML consumers</a>
    and detailed information on related APIs, instead see the
    <a href="references.html#refsHTML5">[HTML5]</a>
    full specification.</p>
  <p>Finally, because this document is intended for use strictly
  as a reference, it does not attempt to also be a tutorial or
  “how to” authoring guide.</p>

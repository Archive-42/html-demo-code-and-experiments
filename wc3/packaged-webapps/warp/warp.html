<h1>WARP, &quot;Widgets Security&quot; Terms, and Prior Art</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>What is WARP?</h2>
<p>By default, Widgets run locally on a computer and cannot access content on the Web (i.e., they have no ability to access anything on the network). So, if widget tries to access an image on the Web, the widget runtime won't allow it by default:</p>
<pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;!-- this will fail by default --&gt;<br />&lt;img src=&quot;http://w3.org/logo.gif&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>To overcome this security restriction, the Working Group created the Widget Access Request Policy (WARP). WARP provides authors with a declarative means to say what domains on the Web a widget will access. For example, if a widget needs to access an image on &quot;w3.org&quot;, the author makes a WARP declaration in the configuration document of a widget:</p>
<pre>&lt;widget xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- Gimme access to W3C resources --&gt;
  &lt;access origin=&quot;http://w3.org&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/widget&gt; </pre>
<p>Having declared an access request, the widget engine will now allow the image to be loaded from the domain w3.org:</p>
<pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br />&lt;!-- the user agent grants access to w3.org! --&gt;<br />&lt;img src=&quot;http://w3.org/logo.gif&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>If at runtime, the widget tries to access foo.com, that access is blocked by the widget engine.</p>
<pre> &lt;!doctype html&gt;
 &lt;!-- this will fail --&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;http://foo.com/hello.gif&quot;&gt;
  </pre>

<p>So, the widget manager uses WARP declarations to decide whether to grant access to networked resources.</p>
<p>The WARP declaration can be used to do other useful things also. For instance, when the user installs a widget, the widget engine can tell the end-user which domains the widget may try to contact. </p>
<p>So, effectively, WARP shares similariteis with  <dfn><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Access_Control">Network Access Control Lists</a></dfn> - particularly in setting who/what can access resources on the Web.</p>
<h2>Software that use Network Access Control Lists</h2>

<h3>XACML </h3>
<p>The XACML specification, which became an OASIS Standard on 18 February 2003, is used  for creating security policies using XML..</p>
<p>Rigo to desc</p>
<h3>CISCO Firewalls</h3>
<p>Retrived from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051103040432/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps1018/products_tech_note09186a00800a5b9a.shtml">Web Archive</a>  Jun 23, 2004 , and see also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021031095829/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_configuration_example09186a0080100548.shtml#allowHTTP">Web Archive October 2002.</a></p>
<p>Just like WARP, CISCO's access control lists (ACLs) can be used to control what resources something can access. Instead of operating at the DNS level, it operates at the IP level:</p>
<pre>access-list acl_permit permit ip 192.168.32.0 0.0.7.255</pre>
<p>The above is used to permis access to all addresses in <code>192.168.32.??</code> range. </p>
<p>These access lists can be grouped together, and then be allowed access to particular types of resources (e.g., resources over HTTP, denoted by <code>www</code> below):</p>
<pre>access-list 102 permit tcp any any eq www
</pre>
<p>Hence, they provide similar functionality to WARP but on a larger scale (i.e., on computers or on routers). </p>
<h3>Netscape: Configurable Security Policies</h3>
<p>Web Archive, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021031095829/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_configuration_example09186a0080100548.shtml#allowHTTP">11 Apr 2000.</a></p>
<p>In terms of security manager operating on requests to network resources, as early as 2000, Netscape navigator introduced <cite>Configurable Security Policies</cite>: </p>
<blockquote><q>This is the idea that users should be able to set up security policies for their browsers, and also have different security policies for different internet sites</q></blockquote>
<p>Much like WARP, these were stored in a text file and allowed a user control over what Websites could/could not do (e.g., a site could be blocked from loading or performing particular actions). In the following example, two websites are blocked from opening popups. </p>
<pre>pref("security.policy.strict.sites","http://www.evil.org http://www.annoying.com");  
pref("security.policy.strict.window.open", "noAccess"); 
</pre>
<h2>Claims, Identifying key words</h2>
<p>The purpose of the claims chart below is to identify key terms in the patent's claim. The intent is to show where differences in meaning between W3C Widget terminology and terminology in the patent. This is to enable the contruction of a claims dictionary.</p>

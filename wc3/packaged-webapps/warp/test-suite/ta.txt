MUST (10 + 1 SHOULD):
In the default policy, a user agent MUST deny access to network resources external to the widget by default, 
whether this access is requested through APIs (e.g. XMLHttpRequest) or through markup (e.g. iframe, script, img).

A user agent SHOULD grant access to network resources listed in the access-request list;
in this case the user agent MUST grant access based on the Rules for Granting Access to a Network Resources.

When a user agent grants access to a given set of network resources, it MUST do so equally for APIs and 
markup.

A user agent MUST add the following to the Table of Configuration Defaults [[!WIDGETS]] in Step 3.

If the origin attribute is absent, then this element is in error and the user agent MUST ignore this element.

If origin is not a valid IRI, if it has components other than scheme and iauthority, if it has no host component, 
or if it has a iuser info component, then this element is in error and the user agent MUST ignore this element.

Let sub domains be the result of applying the rule for getting a single attribute value to the value of the 
subdomains attribute. If the value of sub domains is not a valid boolean value, then this element is in
error and the user agent MUST ignore this element.

If scheme is unsupported by the user agent, then this element isin error and the user agent MUST ignore this element.

If scheme is "http" or "https", then the value of host MUST be processed using the ToASCII algorithm as per
[[!RFC3490]].

If scheme is "http" or "https", the user agent MUST compare hosts in a case-insensitive manner.


MAY (2):
Furthermore, a user agent MAY grant access to certain URI schemes (e.g., mailto:) without the need of an access 
request if its security policy considers those schemes benign.

A user agent MAY deny access requests made via the access element (e.g. based on a security policy, user prompting, etc.).

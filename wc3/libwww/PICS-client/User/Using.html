<H1>How to get Started Writing a PICS complient App</H1>

<A NAME="libraryPrefix"><H2>Library Name Prefix</H2></A>
In an effort to eliminate name conflicts and clarify code, all Pics library 
functions and data types are prepended with CS (for Content Selection). All
source files are also prefixed with CS to avoid module collision. Library
interface headers are prefixed with CSL (for Library), as in CSLUtils.h and 
CSLApp.h.
<P>

<A NAME="components"><H2>Components</H2></A>
The libpics library is divided into two components, accessible through two 
interfaces:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#CSLUtils">CSLUtils</A> - a minimal set of files providing parsing
capabilities for PICS labels and Machine-readable service descritpions.
<LI><A HREF="#CSLApp">CSLApp</A> - component library for building PICS 
applications on top of libwww. It provides the application with automatic 
label requests, parsing of the results, user management, and document 
authorization.
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="CSLUtils"><H1>CSLUtils</H1></A>

The <A HREF="Intrface.html#CSLUtils">CSLUtils</A> interface provides access
to the <A HREF="../src/CSParse.html">basic parser</A>, and its component
parsing objects, <A HREF="../src/CSLL.html">labels</A>, 
<A HREF="../src/CSMR.html">machine-readable service descritpions</A>, 
<A HREF="../src/CSUser.html">sample user profiles</A>.

<H3>Implementation</H3>
This interface is intended to be used by including the component .c and .h 
files in the user's project. It relies on a small subset of the libwww, 
namely the 
<A HREF="../HTUtils">HTUtils</A> portion. These functions provide 
<A HREF="../HTUtils/HTString.html">string</A>, 
<A HREF="../HTUtils/HTList.html">list</A> and 
<A HREF="../HTUtils/HTChunk.html">chunk</A> functionality.
The funtions required by these modules are listed in 
<A HREF="HTFuncs.html">HTFuncs.html</A>.
<P>
<H3>Interface</H3>
The primary purpose for the CSLUtils interface is to provide parsing 
capablilities for PICS labels. <A Href="../LablPars/LablPars.c">LablPars.c</A>
provides an example of this usage.
<P>
<A NAME="howToParse"><H3>How to parse</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#parserCallbacks">create parser callbacks</A>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#targetCallback">targetCallback</A>
<LI><A HREF="#errorHandler">LLErrorHandler</A>
</UL>
<LI><A HREF="#memoryFuncs">assign memory functionality</A>
<LI><A HREF="#callParser">call parser with some or all of the text to be parsed</A>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="parserCallbacks"><H3>parser callbacks</H3></A>
The parser passes through the passed text, building a data structure 
containing all the parsed information, making callbacks to the parser when it
passed to a new data structure or encounters an error.
<P>

<A NAME="targetCallback"><H3>target callbacks</H3></A>
While the parser is reading and filling data structures, it keeps track of 
what data type it is currently filling. Whenever this target data changes, it 
call back to the application. This allows the application to check the data 
that has just been read, or allocate space for the new object. The most common
use of this would be to abort when label data comes through with a value that
is out of range for the user.
<P>

<A NAME="errorHandler"><H3>error handler</H3></A>
The error handler gets called with all parsing problems and data 
inconsistancies. It is intended to provide the interface to the user. The 
return values tells the parser to abort or continue parsing.
<P>

<A NAME="memoryFuncs"><H3>memory functionality</H3></A>
All allocation in libwww or libpics goes through the macros HT_?ALLOC and 
HT_FREE. The macros are assigned to HTMemory functions in HTUtils. The 
developer may subsititue macros for their own proprietary memory system, or 
the ANSI malloc functions. Alternatively, the aplication may employ the 
macros and provide the HTMemory functions, either through the library module 
<A HREF="../../Library/src/HTMemory.c">HTMemory.c</A>, or in their own 
application.
<P>

<A NAME="callParser"><H3>calling the parser</H3></A>
The life cycle of a parse object is as fillows:
<UL>
<LI>Creation - a parse obejct is created to parse PICS labels, service 
descriptions, or user profiles.
<LI>Parsing - the parser gets called with the object data as it comes in. The 
data may be passed in one chunk, but that may not fit network applications.
<LI>Parser destruction - the parser is destroyed, leaving the object that was parsed.
<LI>Object destruction - the object is finally destroyed, recaliming all the memory associated with the above operations.
</UL>

<A NAME="CSLApp"><H1>CSLApp</H1></A>
The <A HREF="Intrface.html#CSLApp">CSLApp</A> provides a library interface for an
application based on <A HREF="../../Library/User/Overview.html">libwww</A>. 
You must first understand how to write an application on top of the 
<A HREF="../../Library/User/Using.html">W3C Sample Code Library</A> (libwww). 
<P>
For details on how to use the library, you should look at the <A
HREF="../src/CSLApp.html">CSLApp.html</A>. 
<P>

The <A HREF="../../LineMode/">Line-Mode Browser</A> uses the CSLApp interface 
to libpics. The steps involved in adapting the Line-Mode Browser to libpics 
are outlined in <A HREF="#steps">steps</A>.

<P>

<A NAME="mechanism"><H2>Mechanism</H2></A>
When libwww is about to send out a request to a server, it calls Pics to send 
a request for Pics ratings. The text of the request is based on the desired 
URL and the current service. This request may accompany the URL request or may 
go to a different server.
<P>
If the request goes to the same server, ie. accompanies the URL request, the 
ratings come back ahead of the requested data. When Pics recieves an answer to 
a service request, it determines whether the URL should be permitted. If there 
is a callback assiciated with this request, Pics calls the callback to allow 
the app to override this descision. If no callback is associated with the 
request, Pics checks to see if there is a default callback for the application.
If either of these callbacks is called, the user or services associated with 
this request or this app may change. If the forbidden disposition remains, the 
request is marked with a Forbidden (403) error and the remaining network 
traffic is killed with a call the HTNet_kill.
<P>
If the ratings must be acquired from another server, the current request is set
to 0 priority and a second request is generated to send the ratings request. 
Once Pics recievs the results of the ratings request, the accompanying URL 
request is either killed off, or restored to high priority which enables the 
request to be sent. When the data returns, the request is already marked as 
allowed and the request passes on to the app.
<P>
<A NAME="steps"><H2>Steps</H2></A>
This quick guide takes you through the basic steps necessary to create your 
own PICS complient application:

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#user">Define a user type</A>
<P>The application must do the fillowing:
See the interface in <A HREF="../src/CSLApp.html">CSLApp.html</A> for details.

<LI><A HREF="#lodU">Load a User</A>
<LI><A HREF="#regA">Register your application with PICS</A>
<LI><A HREF="#regR">Register a request with PICS</A>

<LI><A HREF="#free">When to free Objects</A>
</OL>

<A NAME="user"><H2>User profile</H2></A>

The <A HREF="../src/CSUser.html">CSUser module</A> is a special module in that
defines the the parsing and use of a user profile. It is intended to serve as 
an example, not reference code, as there is no specification for a PICS user.
To furthur it's usability, the password is not encrypted. Possibly a field that
encrypts the password and checks the validity of the rest of the document will 
be used here in the future. In the meantime, it is reccomended that the 
<A HREF="../src/CSUser.c">CSUser.c</A>module be replaced by a proprietary one.
<P>


<A NAME="lodU"><H2>Load a PICS user</H2></A>
This user is kept around for PICS to inspect when creating label requests and
checking values on returns.

<A NAME="regA"><H2>Register an application</H2></A>
This sets of the application's callbacks and 
<A HREF="#defU">default user</A>.

<A NAME="regR"><H2>Register request</H2></A>
The application may have different callbacks and different users associated 
with different users associated with different requests. This is more robust
than defaulting to the user specified in the 
<A HREF="#regA">application registry</A>.

<A NAME="free"><H2>When to free Objects</H2></A>

This is a short set of recommendation on when to free objects in memory.


<DL>
<DT><A HREF="../src/CSParse.html">Parsers</A>

<DD>
These should be destroyed as soon as the object they are parsing is created.
<P>

<DT><A HREF="../src/CSLL.html">PICS Labels</A>
<DT><A HREF="../src/CSMR.html">PICS service descritpions</A>
<DT><A HREF="../src/CSUser.html">User profiles</A>

<DD>
These may be should be around for the duration of the application's use of
the PICS library, though they <EM>can</EM> be freed at any time if they are 
not used by an ongoing request

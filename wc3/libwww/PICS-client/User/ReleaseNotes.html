<H1>Library 1.0 Release Notes</H1>

<H2>Release 0.9 March 20 1996</H2>

This is the first release of the PICS library code. Please see the libpics
<A HREF="Overview.html">Overview</A> for further information. There is very 
likely to be a flurrry of updates with this.
<P>
libpics release 0.9 is built.

GOALS:
<UL>
<LI> Provide a simple interface to the parser for developers not using the 
libwww.<BR>

A subset of the libpics source files have been designed to provide label
parsing for applications that aren't based on libwww. These have a single
interface (CSLUtils) and rely on a minimal set of list and string functions
which may be provided by libwww or the application.

<LI> Provide a PICS library for those developing apps on top of the libwww.<BR>

The remainder of the libpics library is called CSLApp. It relies heavily on
libwww and allows an application based on libwww to easily automate
checking of label bureaus and document servers for ratings. It provides an
interface for checking these against a user profile. A sample user profile
is implemented, though it is intended as an example. Sample PICS users are
available in <A HREF="../Data">Data</A>. These users have passwords that
match their usernames, which, in turn, match their file names.

<LI> Use the LineMode browser to demonstrate use of libpics.<BR>

The LineMode browser has been expanded to use CSLApp to load user profiles
and make sure that subsequent documents may be viewed by these users. The
LineMode browser may be used to check document servers and label bureaus
for PICS functionality.

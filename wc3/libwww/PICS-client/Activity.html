  PICS Sample Code Library Position Statement
</H1>
<P>
The PICS Sample Code Library provides tools for adding PICS functionality to
web applications like browsers, proxies, and PICS selection interfaces. The
PICS Library is intended to demonstrate PICS on a working client (see the
<A HREF="../LineMode">LineMode</A> browser)&nbsp;and to assist builders of
these applications to quickly integrate PICS into their programs. The PICS
Library may be used in conjunction with the <A HREF="../Library">W3C Sample Code
Library</A>, or as a stand-alone collection of utilities. This is the PICS
position statement of direction concerning <A HREF="./">PICS Reference
Library</A> and it is part of the
<A HREF="../Consortium/Prospectus/ActivityList">W3C position statements</A>.
<H2>
  Background
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="./">PICS Sample Code Library</A>, a.k.a. libpics, was written
for the PICS consortium by Eric Prud'hommeuax. It was released to the public
to provide a reference to speed up PICS application development in the web
community.
<H2>
  Current Status
</H2>
<P>
The utility portion of the PICS Library is based on very simple C-code and
makes no architecture assumptions. It should, therefor, be portable to any
platform with a C compiler. The full library may be ported anywhere the
<A HREF="../Library">W3C Sample Code Library</A> may be ported, ie. Unix, MS
Windows, and Macintosh.
<P>
Considerable care was taken in providing a set of APIs that would be extensible
without changing the interface. Only time will tell how well that was
accomplished.
<H2>
  Example Applications
</H2>
<P>
These examples demonstrate the the use of the <A HREF="./">PICS Reference
Library</A>, both in conjunction with the <A HREF="../Library">W3C Sample Code
Library</A>, and as a stand-alone library.

  <DT>
    <A HREF="../LineMode/"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="../Icons/WWW/LMB48x" ALT="LMB"></A> <B>Line
    Mode Browser</B>
  <DD>
    The Line Mode Browser is a character-based Web browser developed for use
    on terminals. It is an example of a client application using the
    <A HREF="./">libwww</A>. It is also useful as a test tool for quick access
    to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc.
  <DT>
    <B><A HREF="LablPars">LablPars</A></B> and
    <B><A HREF="RatPars">RatPars</A></B> demonstrate the use of the PICS parser.
    They check the syntax for PICS lables &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and PICS
    service descriptions respectively.

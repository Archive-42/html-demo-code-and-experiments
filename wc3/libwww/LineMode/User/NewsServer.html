  Defining a News Server
</H1>
<P>
To be able to read news, the <A HREF="../">Line Mode Browser (www)</A> needs
the address of a <A HREF="AboutNewsServers.html" NAME="z2">news server</A>.
This is a machine which runs the NNTP protocol. If you already use internet
news on your site, you will have one of these. There are several ways you
can tell <EM>www</EM>which news server to use.
<P>
Note you may also have your machine enabled as being authorized to pick up
news from the news server by that server's system manager.
<H2>
  For a NeXT
</H2>
<P>
The NeXT defaults are read, looking for a value for "NewsHost" for application
name "WorldWideWeb", then for a global default, then for application named
"News".
<H2>
  All other cases
</H2>
<P>
On all other platforms (?) you can do one of the following in order to define
a news server.
<H3>
  Set an environment variable
</H3>
<P>
You can set the environment variable <B>NNTPSERVER</B> to be the internet
address of the server. As a n example, you can do this in your
<EM>.login</EM> file, or your <EM>.cshrc</EM> file. (On VMS, use a logical
name, on VM/CMS, the CENV globalv table).
<H3>
  Use a file
</H3>
<P>
The file <EM>/usr/local/lib/rn/server</EM> will be read if it exists and
no environment variable is defined. It should contain the single line containing
the name of the news server. This filename may be overridden at compile time
by defining the SERVER_FILE symbol to be the quoted string.
<H3>
  At Compile Time
</H3>
<P>
If you are installing www for several people, you can set the default by
defining the variable <EM>DEFAULT_NEWS_HOST</EM> to be the quoted string
of the server name on the command line for the compilation of the HTNews.c
module For example, use the option (check your own compiler's command line
syntax)
<PRE>
	-DDEFAULT_NEWS_HOST="mynewshost.domain"
</PRE>
<H3>
  Use a domain name alias
</H3>
<P>
If no other default news host is found, the software looks for a machine
with name or alias "news" in the local domain. If your domain has a single
news server which you would like to use as a default, and the person in charge
of the domain name registration agrees, then make an alias "news" for the
server. This will have the management advantage that the administration can
move the news server without any trouble later.

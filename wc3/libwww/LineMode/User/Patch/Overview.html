    <A HREF="lmb_3.1_1.fix">Problem running from scripts or as a cron job</A>
  <DD>
    Version 3.1 of the Line Mode Browser registers STDIN as an channel for user
    input. If the browser is run as a cron job then STDIN comes from
    <CODE>/dev/null</CODE> which always returns ready for reading in a select
    call. Line Mode browser then thinks that the user has interrupted the request
    and exists.

    Better error reporting
  <DD>
    Difficult when many possible paths have been tried. Save log of attempts?
    Portability of error message generation?
  <DT>
    Command wanted: Append
  <DD>
    to a given file a hypertext reference to the document.
  <DT>
    Anchors in paper prints
  <DD>
    If the user needs to print out documents when following links, instead of
    inserting anchor numbers, insert page numbers of the destination nodes, as
    they would appear in the printed document. Do this by first following the
    links with no output on the screen, reading all the files into the buffer
    and calculating the page numbers. Then go through the path again, with output
    directed to the printer, inserting the corresponding page numbers rather
    than the anchor numbers.
  <DT>
    Deal with lists within lists
  <DD>
    This is a part of having a better HTML parser
  <DT>
    Style sheets
  <DD>
    Nested style sheets like everybody is asking for

<H1>Installation under VMS</H1>To install under VMS, get the files
WWW.EXE and SETUP.COM from sources
described below. To set up the commands,
put the command
<PRE>			$ @[...]SETUP

</PRE>into your LOGIN.COM, or the system
SYLOGIN.COM.  This command file assumes
you have left all the distributed
files  in the same directory as itself.

<H2><A NAME=3>Customization using logical names</A></H2>

Under VMS, the home page may be defined using the logical name
WWW_HOME.  You should define this to be the full address of the
document which you want to be displayed when www is invoked without
parameters. For example,

<PRE>        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM WWW_HOME "file://myvax/sys$library/default.html"

</PRE>Note that the www address you must
set it to is still in unix-like format
(with slashes instead of :: : [.])Users
may of course override the system
logical name with their own. If no
logical name is defined, the VMS
browser will default to picking up
the default page from our server,
 document http://www.w3.org./default.html.<P>
The other <A
NAME=4 HREF="Customisation.html">customization variables</A>
may be defined in the same way.<P>
Accessing VMS files<P>
If you are making you own home page,
or any other documentation, you will
probably want to store it on your
VMS machine. The www program has
the ability, if running under VMS,
 to access VMS files. the document
name for a VMS file is simply the
filename, but:<P>
The host name must be the name of
the machine WITHOUT any domain name
on it, e.g. //vxcrna/<P>
The filename is written with each
punctuation converted into a single
slash. Examples are
<PRE> Document identifier           			Filename

 file://vxcrna/sys$www_home			vxcrna::sys$home

</PRE>
<H2><A
NAME=1>Availability of .EXE files</A></H2>Versions are available for any of
the following implementations of
TCP/IP which you may have installed
on your system: Digital's UCX, Wollongongs's
WIN/TCP, or SRI's Multinet.  If you
are on the High Energy Physics DECnet,
the versions are currently (Jan 92)
available compiled in directories
as follows:
<DL>
<DT>Wollongong WIN_TCP
<DD> none - see <A
NAME=6 HREF="Installation_VMS_NewTCP.html#2">recompiling</A>
.
<DT>Multinet
<DD> vxcrna::disk$oc1:[timbl.www.multinet.works]
<DT>Digital's UCX
<DD> vxcrna::disk$oc1:[timbl.www.ucx.works]
<DT>CMU TCP
<DD> none - see <A
NAME=5 HREF="Installation_VMS_NewTCP.html#1">recompiling</A> .
</DL>
If you are not on HEPnet, but can
pick up binary files from w3.org
using FTP,  then you will find executables
in the /pub/www/bin/vms, as files
www_ucx.exe or www_multinet.exe.
Remember to transfer in binary mode.
Pick one and rename it to www.exe
<H2><A
NAME=z7>Rebuilding from source</A></H2>You may have to do this if your sharable
libraries are not compatible with
those for which the .EXE file was
built. If there is a version incompatability,
then you get an explicit message
about sharable library versions when
you try to run www.<P>
If you have utilities for uncompressing
and untarring the main source file,
then you could remake the distribution
from source.<P>
Another way of getting the sources
up can be used if you happen to have
access to an untrix machine on the
same DECnet as your vax. FTP the
source tar file over to the ultrix
machine, uncompress it and untar
it, then copy over the descrip.mms
in LineMode/src/vms. In
there you'll find all the commands
to copy the sources from a unix machine
(PRIAM:: in that instance -- you'll
have to edit it) and rebuild the
.exe. <P>
When you remake the exe, you must
specifify
<PRE>
			MMS/MACRO=(MULTINET=1)
		or

			MMS/MACRO=(WIN_TCP=1)
		or

			MMS/MACRO=(UCX=1)

</PRE>

to get the right version for Multinet, Wollongong TCP or DEC/UCX
respectively.

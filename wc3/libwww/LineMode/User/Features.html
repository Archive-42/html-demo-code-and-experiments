<P>
As always, most of the added features in the Line Mode Browser are a result
of changes to the W3C Sample Code Library. However, the following new features
deserve to be mentioned:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Introduced a more sophisticated verbose mode that takes parameter after the
    -v option. This feature is implemented due to an excessive amount of verbose
    output from the Library and the Browser. The -v option can now be followed
    by none, one, or more of the following characters:
    <DL>
      <DT>
	a
      <DD>
	Anchor relevant information
      <DT>
	p
      <DD>
	Protocol Modules
      <DT>
	s
      <DD>
	SGML/HTML information
      <DT>
	u
      <DD>
	URI management
    </DL>
    <P>
    The <CODE>-v</CODE> flag alone turns on all trace messages. This feature
    is a result of a more advanced TRACE management in the W3C Sample Code Library
  <LI>
    LineMode Browser now supports direct WAIS access. If it is compiled with
    the same WAIS flags in the Makefile as the CERN server then it can access
    a WAIS server directly.
  <LI>
    New command line feature: -m <method> where <method> is one of
    <UL>
      <LI>
	GET
      <LI>
	HEAD
    </UL>
    <P>
    This will later get extended to also include other HTTP methods
  <LI>
    Cyrillic support added for Line Mode Browser. This is a patch from Anton
    Tropashko, agl@glas2.glas.apc.org
  <LI>
    Bug where the Browser prompted the user a UserID and Password in non-interactive
    mode fixed. Now non-interactive <EM>really</EM> means non-interactive.
  <LI>
    The common BUILD for the Line Mode Browser, the CERN Server and the Library
    of common code now accepts a command line option:
    <PRE>
	BUILD linemode | daemon | library
</PRE>
    <P>
    to build a specific component. The default action is to build all three parts.
    BUILD is now also provided in a Bourne Shell version
</UL>
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  2.14 on November 1994
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Added <A HREF="CommandLine.html#z28" NAME="z1">-reformat</A> option to allow
    www to be used for generating HTML in cannonical form for running diffs,
    putting into code managemenst systems, etc.
  <LI>
    The Browser now understands the "ALT" tag in
    <A HREF="../../MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_21.html">HTML Inlined Images</A>
  <LI>
    Loads the <A HREF="CommandLine.html"> Command Line Help</A> if called with

  <LI>
    This release of the Line Mode Browser is mainly a debugged version that is
    brought up to date with the WWW library version 2.15. For the changes in
    the Client side of the Library, see
    <A HREF="../../Library/User/History.html" NAME="z16">Changes to W3 Common
    Library</A> . See also <A HREF="Commands.html" NAME="z17">existing commands</A>
    and <A HREF="CommandLine.html" NAME="z18">command line syntax</A> .

    Using the save function "&gt;" now checks if file exists. Use "!&gt;" to
    overwrite it. All save functions now put up an output stream instead of making
    a system call.
  <LI>
    The -from command line option can be used in filter mode (using a "-") in
    order to specify the input format.
  <LI>
    In Non-interactive mode, no third party programs are called through "save
    &amp; execute". If the Browser finds gets an unknown format, the result is
    put onto standard output.

    formatting of any text before a heading etc was wrong (no paragraph spacing,
    indents, etc).
  <LI>
    Bug fix: Newlines in HTML source are not taken as blanks if they follow other

</UL>
<H2>
  November 1991 version 0.14
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    The `Recall' command now displays references as `R 1', `R 2', etc. instead
    of just `1', `2', etc. so the user is reminded to type `R &lt;number&gt;'.

    file or index you want to start with.
  <LI>
    Keyword search accepts longer strings.
  <LI>
    On VMS, VMS files may be accessed. The WWW address is still unix-like, with
    slashes, and is converted into VMS syntax by the browser. VMS users can now
    write their own hypertext and keep it on VMS, though it will only be readable
    (at the moment) from VMS machines.
</UL>
<H2>
  November 91 version 0.9
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Bug fix in anonymous FTP. The first version with a-ftp access.

</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Parameters avaliable on the command line :-
</UL>
<DL>
  <DT>
    -v
  <DD>
    Shows trace comments, including the pathways taken to locate a file.
  <DT>
    -n
  <DD>
    Makes the program non interactive with the user. No prompts are shown, and
    after the node is displayed it exits the program
  <DT>
    -p
  <DD>
    Turns off the paging. The page size can be selected by adding the value
    immediately after the 'p'.
  <DT>
    -a
  <DD>
    Stops positions of anchors being shown in the text.
</DL>
<UL>
  <LI>
    These options are particulary useful when redirecting the input into either
    a file or to the printer. They can also be used in any order on the command
    line, as long as 'WWW' is the first arguement.
  <LI>
    When the recall command is used to view what files have been visited, the
    titles of the files are used, rather than the file name. If there is no title
    then the file name is used.
</UL>
<H2>
  14 May 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    The function HTOpen() called from HTAccess has been changed so that it takes
    two parameters instead of one. This extra one being a pointer to an address
    where the format style is stored as an integer. The translations of the integers
    to the formats can be seen in WWW.h. At the momment this extra parameter
    is not used but will be in the near future so that more files can be accessed.
</UL>
<H2>
  10 May 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    WWW now reads the formatted text into a double linked buffer one screen full
    at a time and then produces it on the screen. This enables checking of documents
    so that splitting of small paragraphs or titles does not occur at the bottom
    of the screen.
  <LI>
    An option is offered to return to the top of the present document being viewed.
  <LI>
    Tim added the necessary code so that WWW can now access remote files using
    anonymous FTP.
</UL>
<H2>
  17 April 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Modified WWW so that it is also executable on the SUN machines., i.e. using
    ordinary C.
  <LI>
    First version realeased on PRIAM, for testing by a few users, to gain feedback.
  <LI>
    Accepts keywords with the execute command.
</UL>
<H2>
  8 April 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Keywords can be entered on the command line.
  <LI>
    The input file is copied into a buffer as soon as it is opened, so that the
    input channel is closed as soon as possible and the server freed. The first
    23 lines of the document are read into the buffer and produced onto the screen.
    As soon as this is done, the remaining file is read into the buffer so the
    input channel is closed.
</UL>
<H2>
  7 March 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Created an array called 'string_space' which is filled with blank spaces
    to be used for printing out margins etc. This method of printing a string
    was found to be faster than individually printing spaces.
  <LI>
    A history mechanism has been included so that a list of all the documents
    viewed are stored so that the user can refer back to them using the BACK,
    HOME and RECALL commands.
  <LI>
    Changed code so that the browser can handle text which contains long words
    which exceed the allowed line length on their own. This is just done by
    continuing the word on the following line.
  <LI>
    Read titles and headings into a buffer before outputting so that in cases
    where the title has a word longer than the allowed line length can be dealt
    with (for example above).This could also be useful in helping to solve the
    above problem. Maybe extend the length of headings.
</UL>
<H2>
  5 March 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Handles a "LISTING" tag by treating it in the same way as an "XMP" tag. This
    is because, in the case of the line mode browser, the screen is limited to
    80 columns and so the browser is unable to work with the 132 columns which
    the "LISTING" tag normally expects.
  <LI>
    Handles an "ADDRESS" tag, which left justifies the text.
</UL>
<H2>
  27 Feb 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Lists and the help menu are not so spread out, as before.
  <LI>
    The browser works with file numbers rather than the file pointers.
  <LI>
    Tidied up paging, with the last line of a page repeated at top of next.
  <LI>
    Deals with tags within anchors.
</UL>
<H2>
  11 Feb 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    HTTP access to cernvm server, including FIND and NEWS tested.
  <LI>
    Browser can be executed by 'WWW' , 'YP' (yellow pages), 'XNEWS', or 'FIND'.
  <LI>
    "PLAINTEXT" tag added. Prints out the node exactly as it finds it in the
    file.
  <LI>
    Prompt only contains appropriate options, as does the help message.
  <LI>
    Keyword search option added.
</UL>
<H2>
  Before Feb 91
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Text formatting and line wrapping completed to a reasonable standard.
  <LI>
    Removed section of program where 'r' has to be entered in order to select
    a reference.
  <LI>
    When no hypertext references have been found, the browser informs the user,
    and doesn't offer the list option in the help menu.
  <LI>
    Produces an error message if the user tries to select a reference or menu,
    when no references have been found.
  <LI>
    Records whether an anchor is a NAME or an HREF.
  <LI>
    Stop **** END **** (now [End]) appearing in the wrong places. This problem
    appears due to the lines in the html file being too long, so this causes
    an error in the 'C' run time.
  <LI>
    Handles a glossary.

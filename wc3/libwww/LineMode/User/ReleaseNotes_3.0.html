covered by the new CERN copyright statement. The statement is
published in the file <B>COPYRIGH</B> (truncated to 8 bytes) in the

format</A>.<P>

As always, most of the added features in the Line Mode Browser are a
result of changes to the <A HREF="../../Libra../">Library
of Common Code</A>. Most of the code is reorganized in order to adapt
the application to the multithreaded version of the Library. This
means that the browser now has the following new features:

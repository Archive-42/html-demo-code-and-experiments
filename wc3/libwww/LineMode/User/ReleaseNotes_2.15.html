<H1>Line Mode Browser 2.15 Release Notes</H1>

<HR>

As always, most of the added features in the Line Mode Browser are a
result of changes to the <A HREF="../../Libra../">Library
of Common Code</A>. However, the following new features deserve to be
mentioned:

<UL>

<LI>Introduced a more sophisticated verbose mode that takes parameter
after the -v option. This feature is implemented due to an excessive
amount of verbose output from the Library and the Browser. The -v
option can now be followed by none, one, or more of the following
characters:

<DL>

<DT>a

<DD>Anchor relevant information

<DT>p

<DD>Protocol Modules

<DT>s 

<DD>SGML/HTML information

<DT>u

<DD>URI management

</DL>

The <CODE>-v</CODE> flag alone turns on all trace messages. This
feature is a result of a more advanced TRACE management in the Library
of Common Code

<LI>LineMode Browser now supports direct WAIS access. If it is
compiled with the same WAIS flags in the Makefile as the CERN server
then it can access a WAIS server directly.

<LI>New command line feature: -m <method> where <method> is one of

<UL>
<LI>GET
<LI>HEAD
</UL>

This will later get extended to also include other HTTP methods

<LI>Cyrillic support added for Line Mode Browser. This is a patch from
Anton Tropashko, agl@glas2.glas.apc.org

<LI>Bug where the Browser prompted the user a UserID and Password in
non-interactive mode fixed. Now non-interactive <EM>really</EM> means
non-interactive.

<LI>The common BUILD for the Line Mode Browser, the CERN Server and
the Library of common code now accepts a command line option:

<PRE>
	BUILD linemode | daemon | library
</PRE>

to build a specific component. The default action is to build all
three parts. BUILD is now also provided in a Bourne Shell version

</UL>

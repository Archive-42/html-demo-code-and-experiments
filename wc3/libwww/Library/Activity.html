  Why Libwww?
</H1>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ceveil.qc.ca/normes-ietf-francisation.html#Heading5"><EM>Rough
consensus and running code</EM></A> is the&nbsp;main idea behind libwww.
As for all <A HREF="/Status.html">W3C OpenSource code</A>, the purpose of
libwww is to provide an environment for experimenting with extensions and
new features. The focus of libwww is performance, modularity, and extensibility.
It contains highly efficient code for <A HREF="../Protocols/">HTTP</A> and
<A HREF="/Addressing/">URIs</A> but also for many other parts of the Web,
primarily for client side applications like <A HREF="../Robot/">robots</A>,
<A HREF="../Amaya/">browsers</A>, <A HREF="../WinCom/">GUI apps</A>, and
<A HREF="../ComLine/">automated tools</A>.
<P>
Libwww has been part of the World Wide Web almost from the beginning.
<A HREF="../People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</A> designed and implemented
the first version back in <A HREF="User/History.html">November 1992</A> as
part of demonstrating the potential of the Web. Many people have picked up
libwww and used it in a variety of contexts. Applications such as Lou Montulli's
Lynx character based client, Mosaic Web browser by Marc Andreesen and Eric
Bena, and the CERN server by Ari Luotonen were all using later versions of
libwww. Later on, applications like the Arena browser by Dave Raggett and
H&aring;kon W. Lie have been added to the list.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/Public/ACHIEVEMENTS/WEB/cerncontext.html">Thanks
to CERN</A>, libwww was free from the very start and was released on a regular
basis to the Web Community. When <A HREF="/History.html">CERN stopped being
the center of the Web</A> in late 1994, libwww moved from
<A HREF="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</A> to <A HREF="/">W3C</A> which continued
its development. In May 1998, the code base was made even more available
in that people now can check it out <A HREF="cvs.html">directly from our
CVS codebase</A>. Today, libwww is freely available under
<A HREF="Overview.html#Legal">W3C Copyright</A> for use by anyone and has
a growing <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">OpenSource</A> community helping
maintaining it.
<P>
Along with the core library comes set of
<A HREF="User/Applications.html">sample applications</A> that demonstrate
how to use libwww but at the same time can perform useful tasks in their
own right.
<P>
As all OpenSource software, the growth depends on you - it doesn't happen
by itself. <A HREF="Collaborators.html">Check out what you can do</A> in
order to help moving <A HREF="./">libwww</A> forward and making it stronger
and more useful to everybody.

<H1>CERN Library 3.0 Prerelease 3 (TEST OF WINDOWS PORT)</H1>

<HR>

This is the announcement of the <A
HREF="/pub/src/WWWLibrary_3.0pre3.tar.Z">CERN Common Code Library
3.0pre3</A>. This beta-release is the last before the real thing. It
contains a set of bug fixes, new interface <B>AND A PORT TO
PC/WINDOWS</B> based on Winsock. The purpose of this last prerelease
before the official 3.0 release is to get feedback from PC/WINDOWS
developers so that we can get better support in Library version
3.0. Some more information:

<OL>

<LI>I have used Microsoft Virtual C++ (msvc) and a so-called project.
One of the problems using this is that it generates a non-standard
make file. Also, msvc automaticly scans for all dependencies. However,
it doesn't use a preprocessor, so if an include file is within

<PRE>
	#ifdef unix
	#include &lt;system.h&gt;
	#end
</PRE>

it is taken as a dependency. There are two solutions to this: Either
create dummy include files or hand tailor the make file.  I chose the
second solution.

<LI>The TCP/IP library used is Winsock.

<LI>I have tried to compile the library in two modes:

<UL>
<LI>Static library (.lib)
<LI>Dynamic Library (.dll)
</UL>

When making a <B>DLL</B>, neither <CODE>stdin</CODE>,
<CODE>stdout</CODE>, <CODE>stderr</CODE> nor a lot of system calls are
defined. This is a problem as I haven't solved all the problems of
unresolved references to system calls. I hope to get some help on this
one! This is not a problem using a LIB, but it isn't as interesting
either.

<LI>There are still global memory that's not getting freed at the
end. I hope that the <CODE>WWWLibTerminate()</CODE> will make this
easier. Especially the anchors is a problem.

</OL>

The <A HREF="/pub/src/WWWLineMode_3.0pre3.tar.Z"> Line Mode
Browser</A> is also released in order to show how the multithreaded
functionality can be enabled. The method used in the Line Mode Browser
is not limited to character-based clients but can support GUI clients
as well. <P>

Its is known to compile on Sun4, Solaris 2, HP Snake, NeXT, NeXT-386,
Decstation Ultrix, DEC OSF/1, SGI, AIX, PC/WINDOWS and <A
HREF="Platform/Platform.html">possibly a lot more</A>. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif" ALT="NOTE"> The Library is
not compatible with the CERN server 3.0 and it should NOT be linked
with this application. A later release of the CERN server will support
the current Library. <P>

<H2>New or Changed Features</H2>

<LI>Made a <B>WWWLib.h</B> include file which should be the only one
necessary <B>DON'T USE ANYTHING ELSE!!!</B>

<LI>Replaced TRACE messages from stderr to using a macro TDEST On
windows and other use local file

<LI>Due to the PC Port some files have changed names (max 8 chars):

<UL>
<LI>s?HTFWrite.h?HTFWrite.h?g
<LI>s?HTHist.h?HTHist.h?g
<LI>s?HTEPtoCl.h?HTEPtoCl.h?g
<LI>s?HTDescpt.h?HTDescpt.h?g
<LI>s?HTXParse.h?HTXParse.h?g
<LI>s?HTErrMsg.h?HTErrMsg.h?g
</UL>

<LI>Move EnableFrom to HTAccess.html

<LI>Sockets are no longer assumed to be small, unsigned integers, but
uses macros

<LI>Introduced error_stream as field in HTRequest structure. This
enables the client to get the `dead information' that follows in a 3xx
request, 4xx request etc.

<H2>Bug Fixes</H2>

<UL>
<LI>file:// no more tries ftp:// if host=localhost
<LI>Improved proxy support and fixed bug
<LI>Bug fixed in HTGetHostName()
<LI>Bug fixed if UserID/passwd not correct and don't want to retry
<LI>HTNewsHost is now a local variable. Use HTGetNewsHost and HTSetNewsHost
<LI>HTErrorAdd and HTErrorSysAdd no always return HT_ERROR
<LI>Fixed bug in HTGetDomainName when no domain name is present at all
<LI>Introduced Headermask into request structure
<LI>Add output_flush to request structure
<LI>Created HTDateTimeStr() in HTString
<LI>Removed HTEnableFrom (replaced by HeaderMask in request)
<LI>HTWriter added a parameter in stead of HTWriterNoClose()
<LI>Removed HTInetStatus. Done by HTErrnoString
<LI>Introduced socerrno and errno
<LI>Uses IOCTL as a macro now - not fcntl
<LI><EM>and a lot of other stuff...</EM>
</UL>

Have fun!

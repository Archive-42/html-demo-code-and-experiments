  The Alert Class
</H1>
<P>
The Alert class defines a set of methods to be used by libwww to be used
for passing prompts and message to a user. In order to maintain the Library
core application independent and natural language independent, libwww does
not know how to communicate with a <I>user</I>. Note here that a <I>user</I>
is a somewhat abstract notion for &nbsp;something that can receive a message
or prompt from the Library. This can for example be a person, but is may
also be handled automatically by a robot or a client receiving a response
from a HTTP server.
<P>
Libwww has a set of <B>opcodes</B> that classifies the nature of the message,
for example that it is a question that must be confirmed in order to continue
a request or simply a progress notification. The application can register
a method for any number of the defined opcodes - in case the Library has
a message for an opcode that does not have a method associated, the message
is ignored. You can also globally disable any message send from the Library.

  Post Webs - a Generic Model for Posting on the Web
</H1>
<P>
The <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> PUT and POST are required features
when extending the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">Web</A> to a fully collaborative
tool with features like remote authoring, annotations, update of data bases
etc. Many Web applications are currently capable of transferring data from
HTML forms to a HTTP server. However, form data is typically small amounts
of text based data, and a more generic mechanism is needed for transmitting
an arbitrary data object to any kind of remote server. This document describes
how this functionality can be provided by the "Post Web" model and how this
model interacts with the user, the application, and the <A HREF="../../">W3C
Sample Code Library</A>. One of the advantages of this model is that it does
not require any modification, neither to the
<A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.0</A> specification nor to the
<A HREF="../../../MarkUp/">HTML</A> form definition.
<P>
<H2>
  What is a Post Web?
</H2>
<P>
A "Post Web" is used as an abstraction mechanism for enabling the user to
perform multiple operations (methods) on a data object rendered in multiple
representations determined for multiple destinations. This may seem complicated
but the Post Web is in fact a very simple model as will become clear in the
following sections. The purpose of the Post Web is to take a set of common
situations from the world of email and news; merge it with the features of
HTTP, and put the result into the Web model. This leads to the following
set of requirements:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A post operation can involve one source and a multiple number of destinations.
  <LI>
    The source can either be a URL referencing a local or a remote data object,
    or it can be any object internally managed by the application, for example
    a memory buffer containing a document created by the user.
  <LI>
    Any of the destinations can be a URL referencing either a local or a remote
    data object. The object may or may not exist by the time the posting is
    initiated.
  <LI>
    The model must not be limited to use HTTP but should be a generic mechanism
    for any kind of access scheme supported by the Web model.
  <LI>
    The model must provide possibility for data format conversion from one media
    type to another on the fly when the data object is moved from the source
    to one or more of the destinations.
  <LI>
    The user must be able to specify a relation between a source and any of the
    destinations, for example "Written by". This is equivalent to the
    "&lt;LINK&gt;" element in HTML and the "Link:" header in HTTP and is used
    to incorporate semantics into the Web topology.
  <LI>
    It must be possible to specify individual operations used for each destination
    where an operation can be any non-idempotent operation (or method) defined
    by <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.0</A>. For example, if three destinations
    are specified then one can use PUT, another POST, and the third can use LINK.
    In the following, post written in lower case refers to any non-idempotent
    HTTP method whereas POST written in uppercase refers to a specific HTTP method.
</UL>
<P>
The Post Web model provides a homogeneous interface to a post operation
regardless of the destination, the specific method, and the data format used.
It describes the full operation from defining the source and destinations
to actually transfer the data over the network. This process involves there
players: the user, the application, and the W3C Sample Code Library. Each of
these uses the Post Web model but on different levels of abstraction:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="#user">The user</A>
  <DD>
    To the user, the Post Web is a way of defining a source object and one or
    more destinations to where the object is to be posted. The model allows the
    user to describe relations between the source and any of the destinations
    and also what method should be used.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="#client">The application</A>
  <DD>
    To the application, the Post Web is a set of bindings between a source and
    any of the destinations describing a request for changing the current Web
    topology. A binding is described by the link itself, a link relation, the
    method (operation) to be performed, and if any data format conversion has
    to be performed.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="#library">The Library</A>
  <DD>
    The Library interprets the Post Web as a set of related requests specifying
    the access scheme, the operation to be done, the data flow between them,
    and the data formats in this data flow.
</DL>
<P>
The following paragraphs describe the three layers of abstraction, how they
are interconnected and thus defining the Post Web model.
<H2>
  <A NAME="user">The User Builds a Post Web</A>
</H2>
<P>
For all the possible destinations in a Post Web, the user can specify what
method should be applied, any relations between the source and any of the
destinations, and if any data for conversion should be performed. The relations
are semantically identical to the <A HREF="../../../MarkUp/">HTML</A> "Link"
tag and the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> "Link" header, and it
can for example describe authorship, relations to other data objects etc.
<P>
The description of the Post Web model includes a basic example in which a
user wants to post the same data object or variations thereof to two mailing
lists, a news group and at the same time store the data object on a remote
HTTP server. This scenario can be graphically represented as a Post Web
consisting of five nodes: one source and four destinations:
<P>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="PostWebUser.gif" ALT="User's View" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="283">
<P>
This document does not specify the user interface for building a Post Web
as this is tightly connected to the platform involved, but obviously it should
take advantage of any graphic features etc. Typically a GUI-client could
use drag-and-drop icons for building the Web. For example, the Post Web could
be visualized using a collection of icons representing commonly used recipients
and then let the user drag lines between the data object to be posted and
the recipients.
<P>
When the user has finished specifying the source, the destinations, the methods,
and any relations between them, the user's version of the Post Web is ready
to be submitted and the application can take the information and convert
it to a lower abstraction level.
<H2>
  <A NAME="application">The Application Generates a Request</A>
</H2>
<P>
While the description of the user's view of a Post Web is fairly abstract,
an actual application must transform the information into a specific
representation supported by the Library. To the application, the Post Web
is a request for change in the topology of the Web. The application can describe
this change using <A HREF="../../src/HTAnchor.html#anchor">anchor objects</A>
which is the Library's representation of the Web where each node represents
a data object or a subpart of a data object that the application has been
in contact with while browsing on the Web.
<P>
In the figure below, each of the four anchors has a data object and a URL
related to it. Any of the addresses or data objects may or may not exist
when the Post Web is submitted by the application. If the source does not
exist then this will result in an error, but if a destination data object
does exist then the post operation is committed then might result in replacement,
deletion, update, or any other outcome as a result of the method applied.
<P>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="PostWebApp.gif" ALT="Application's View" WIDTH="535" HEIGHT="328">
<P>
The Library provides an API for handling anchor objects including how to
link the objects together as indicated in the figure above. This is explained
in more detail in the <A HREF="../Guide/">User's Guide</A>.
<P>
<H2>
  <A NAME="library">The Library Serves the Request</A>
</H2>
<P>
When the application has bound the source anchor to the destination anchors
with the appropriate methods and link relations, the Post Web can be handed
over to the Library in order to transfer the data object from the source
to the destinations. The Library is responsible for handling the actual protocol
communication, and hence this part of the Post Web model is the lowest layer
of abstraction. Therefore the design goals for this layer of the Post Web
is somewhat more technical than the first two layers:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Posting to multiple destinations must be compatible with libwww threads and
    extern thread implementations. In the case of libwww threads, it must use
    non-blocking, interruptible I/O.
  <LI>
    The Library must be capable of handling concurrent write and read operations
    to and from the network.
  <LI>
    There must be no timing requirements that can lead to race conditions between
    any of the destinations and the source or between destinations.
  <LI>
    Redirections and access authentication must be handled on both the source
    side and any of the destinations.
</UL>
<P>
Internally, the Library represents a Post Web in two different ways: A
<EM>static</EM> and a <EM>dynamic</EM> binding between the source the
destinations. The static binding is created when the application issues the
request, and it exists until all the sub-requests in the Post Web have reached
a final state. The dynamic binding depends on the data flow and exists only
as long as data is passed through the Post Web. The dynamic binding can be
set up and taken down independently of the static binding, and often this
happens multiple times during the handling of a request.
<P>
As described in the section "<A HREF="DataStructures.html#request">Core Objects
</A>", the <A HREF="../../src/HTReqMan.html">HTRequest</A> object is one
of the core objects used to describe a request from the application. This
object is used in the static binding between the source and the destinations
and it is initialized as soon as the request is passed to the Library from
the application.
<P>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="PostWebReq.gif" ALT="libwww's Request View" WIDTH="388" HEIGHT="305">
<P>
At this point no information is known about the data object itself, so the
static binding only contains information about who the source and the
destinations are. The dynamic binding carries information about data format,
content length and other essential metainformation about the object. The
dynamic binding is basically a stream chain that is established as this
information gets available from the source server:
<P>
<P>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="PostWebStream.gif" ALT="libwww's Stream View" WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="303">
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    As soon as the source server (which might be the local file system or a remote
    HTTP server) is ready to accept a request, it is sent of by the Library.
  <LI>
    The Library then waits until the source server starts sending back a response.
    In the mean time, the application can issue request other requests as the
    model is based on non-blocking I/O.
  <LI>
    As soon as data arrives and the data format is identified, the dynamic bindings
    between the source and the destinations can be setup. The binding is basically
    a connection between the target of the source request and the input of any
    of the destination requests.In the case of multiple destination, T-streams
    can be added to supply the required number of outgoing data flows.
  <LI>
    The destination is now ready for transmitting a request. In the case of HTTP,
    the destination request can not be transmitted before the full header is
    known, which is when the meta information from the source data object is
    parsed.
  <LI>
    A response will arrive to each of the destination requests determining whether
    the posting can continue or not.
  <LI>
    When the dynamic binding is established, any data format conversion can be
    inserted between the target of the source request and the input of any of
    the destination requests. A converter can either be placed directly at the
    target or on any of the inputs, so that all destinations can have different
    renditions of the data object. As the content length often will change as
    a converter other than a through line is used, it can be required to insert
    a content length counter stream which will buffer the data object before
    it is emitted from the stream.
</OL>
<H2>
  Updating the Web Topology
</H2>
<P>
The application can use the result of the operation returned from the Library
to either regard the change in the topology of the Web as successful, erroneous,
or any degree in between. The application can use this information to for
example update any graphical visualization of the part of the Web that the
user has traversed.
<P>
The result of posting a data object varies from protocol to protocol. Typically
transaction oriented protocols can provide an immediate result whereas relayed
protocols can not. As a general rule in the design of the Library other protocols
than HTTP should be supported but not extended beyond their individual
limitations. This means that the Library has to be flexible enough to handle
more than one result from a posting transaction dependent on the protocol
used. As an example, an immediate result from a post transaction is available
using NNTP or HTTP whereas the result from SMTP might be delayed several
days. In practice there is no way that the application can await a response
for that amount of time, and it should therefore be treated as "Accepted"
with no guarantee of completeness.
<P>
The Library handles the update of the internal anchor representation of the
Web by registering the outcome of each post operation and bind that to the
link between the source and the destination. This allows the application
to query how two anchors are related and what the outcome of the operation
was that caused the link to be established.

  Threads and Event Loops
</H1>

<p>Libwww is not posix thread safe but it uses a 'pseudo-thread' model
based on non-blocking sockets and interleaved IO. The <a
href="../../src/HTEvent.html">Event class</a> defines any event
manager to be used by libwww for handling events. Work has been going
on in making libwww posix thread safe but the results have always been
that we loose a lot of performance.</p>

<p>There is no default event loop registered by libwww, but there is a
<a href="../../src/HTEvtLst.html">sample implementation using pseudo
threads (non-blocking sockets and interlaced I/O)</a>. This can be
replaced with another eventloop if you like. If you are using the
libwww pseudo threads on Unix then an event is when the
<I>select()</I> system call returns a notification on a socket
descriptor, but it may as well be an asynchronous event from the
windows manager etc. If your application is not using anything but
traditional blocking sockets then you do not need an event manager at
all. In that case, libwww will block on any socket or system call
until the process can proceed.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../src/HTEvent.html">libwww event manager
interface</a> is very simple as it consists of <B>registering</B> a
<I>socket descriptor</I>, the <I>location</I> in the program, and the
<I>current state</I> when an operation (for example <CODE>read</CODE>)
would block. When the event manager at a later point in time gets a
notification that the socket has become ready, it can then call libwww
with the state saved from the registration and libwww can continue.</p>

<p>Second, libwww must be able to <B>unregister</B> a socket when it is
not anymore in a state where it can block. <I>Only</I> in case the
application wishes to use <I>non-blocking</I> sockets it should
register methods for handling the <B>registration</B> process as
described below.</p>
<H3>
  Providing Call Back Functions
</H3>
<P>Libwww normally handles the creation and termination of its internal
threads without any interaction required by the application. The
thread model is based on call back functions of which at least one
user event handler and a event terminator must must be supplied by the
application. However, the application is free to register as many
additional user event handlers as it wants.</p>

    User Event Handlers
  <DD>
    An application can register a set of user event handlers to handle events
    on sockets defined by the application to contain actions taken by the user.
    This can for example be interrupting a request, start a new request, or scroll
    a page. However, this requires that the actual window manager supports
    redirection of event on sockets.
  <DT>
    Request Termination
  <DD>
    When a request is finished, the set of <a
    href="../Using/Filters.html">registered filters</a> are called to
    update whatever needs to be done, for example updating the history
    list etc.
  <DT>
    Timeout Handler
  <DD>
    When using pseudo threads, the <CODE>select()</CODE> function in libwww
    event loop is blocking even though the sockets are non-blocking. This means
    that if no actions are pending on any of the registered sockets then the
    application will block in the <CODE>select() </CODE>call. However, in order
    to avoid sockets hanging around forever, a timeout is provided so that hanging
    threads can be terminated.
</DL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="control">Returning from a Call Back Function</A>
</H3>
<P>
Often an event handler needs to return information about a change of state
as a result of an action executed by the handler, for example if a new request
is issued, a ongoing request is interrupted, the application is to terminated
etc. This information can be handed back to libwww using the return
values of the call back function.</p>

<p>A requst can be be terminated prematurely by either a <a
href="../../src/HTTimer.html">timeout</a> or an <a
href="../../src/HTReq.html#Killing">abort of the operation</a>. Both
cases can be handled by libwww and be adjusted to the desire of the
user and or application.</p>

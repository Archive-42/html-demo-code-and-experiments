  The Cache Manager
</H1>
<P>
Caching is a required part of any efficient Internet access applications
as it saves bandwidth and improves access performance significantly in almost
all types of accesses. This sections describes the architecture behind the
cache management in the Library. The cache management is intended to be used
both as a proxy cache and a client cache or simply as a cache relay. It does
not include the interaction between an application and a proxy server as
this is regarded as an external access and hence outside the scope of the
local cache. The basic structure of the cache is illustrated in the figure
below.
<P>

<P>
The figure described the cache hierarchy starting from left to right; it
does not describe the data flow. Any of the three cache handlers can be left
out in which case a cache request will fall through to the next handler in
the hierarchy and finally be passed to the protocol manager which issues
a request to either the origin server, a proxy server, or a gateway. Any
of the handlers can also be short circuited by using a set of cache directives
which are explained in the <A HREF="../Using/Cache.html">User's Guide</A>.
In the following, each part will be described in more detail.
<H2>
  <A NAME="memcache">Memory Cache</A>
</H2>
<P>
The memory cache is completely handled by the application and is only consulted
by the Library when servicing a request. It is considered private to a specific
instance of an application and is not intended to be shared between instances.
Handling the memory cache includes the following tasks: object storage, garbage
collection, and object retrieval. The application can initiate a memory cache
handler by registering a call back function that is called from within the
Library on each request. The details of this registration is described in
the <A HREF="../Using/Cache.html">User's Guide</A>.
<P>
Traditionally, the memory cache is based on handling the graphic objects
described by the <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> object in memory as the user keeps
requesting new documents. The <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> object is only declared
in the Library - the real definition is left to the application as it is
for the application to handle graphic objects. For example, the Line Mode
Browser has its own definition of the <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> object called
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/src/GridText.html" ><CODE>HText</CODE></A> which
describes a fully parsed HTML object with enough information to display itself
to the user. However, the memory cache handler can handle other objects than
HTML, for example images, audio clips etc. It is important to note that the
Library does not imply any limitations on the usage of the memory cache.
<P>
The memory cache must define its own garbage collection algorithm which can
be based on available memory etc. Again, the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line
Mode Browser</A> has a very simple memory management of how long objects
stay around in memory. It is determined by a constant in the
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/src/GridText.c" >GridText</A> module and is by
default set to 5 documents. This approach can be much more advanced and the
memory garbage collection can be determined by the size of the graphic objects,
when they expire etc. but the API is the same no matter how the garbage collector
is implemented.
<H2>
  Private File Cache
</H2>
<P>
The private file cache is to be regarded as a direct extension of the memory
cache as intended for intermediate term storage of data objects. As the memory
cache, it is intended to be private to a single instance of an application
as long as the instance is running. However, as a file cache is persistent,
it can be shared between several instances of various applications as long
as exactly one instance owns the private cache at any one time. The single
ownership of a private cache means that the cache can be accessed via the
local file system by one instance of an application only.
<P>
There are two purposes of the private file cache:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    To maintain a persistent cache for applications that do not have a shared
    cache.
  <LI>
    To maintain a private persistent cache for specific groups of documents that
    are not to be shared among other applications. Examples of such are documents
    with a HTTP header <EM>Pragma: Private</EM> which will be introduced in HTTP/1.1
</OL>
<P>
Often an important difference between the memory cache and the file cache
is the format of the data. As mentioned above, in the memory cache, the cached
objects can be pre-parsed objects ready to be displayed to the user. In a
file cache the data objects are always stored along with their metainformation
so that important header information like Expires, Last-Modified, Language
etc. is a part of the stored object together with any unknown metainformation
that might be a part of the object.
<H2>
  Shared File Cache
</H2>
<P>
A shared file cache which can be accessed by several independent applications
requires its own cache manager in order to ensure a consistent cache and
to handle garbage collection. A shared file cache can in many ways be regarded
as similar to a proxy cache as a single application do not know when a cached
object is either discarded or refreshed in the shared cache area.
<P>
If a shared cache manager does exist then the only remaining purpose of a
private file cache is to store explicitly private objects. All other objects
will be stored in the shared cache.
<P>
As for the private file cache, the data objects are always stored along with
their metainformation so that any metainformation associated with an object
can be returned to the requesting application.

  The Protocol Class
</H1>
<P>
The Protocol class defines an application level protocol (HTTP, FTP, Gopher,
etc.) to be used by libwww. Please note that access to the local file system
also is considered to be an application level protocol treated identically
to for example the HTTP protocol. The Protocol class does only know about
the application layer protocol and it relies on the
<A HREF="../../src/HTTrans.html">Transport Class</A> to do the actual
communication with the network, the local file system etc. The protocol class
defines an access method for both a client and a server. A typical client
application would probably only want to use the client method and a server
only the server method. However, any application can use both which allows
it to seamlessly to change between server and client profile as needed.
<P>
Libwww doesn't know anything about protocol modules. This has the big advantage
that an application can register any number of protocols including access
to the local file system. Libwww is independent of whether you make an
application capable of speaking all known Internet protocols or only can
access, for example a HTTP server - to the Library it's all a set of callback
functions.
<P>
The Protocol object handles two types of callback functions: one for a client
application and one for a server application. This means that you can register
not only any type of protocol clients but also their server counterparts.
Whether it is a client module or a server module, a protocol module is identified
by an access scheme which is identical to the access scheme known from the
URL syntax, for example
<PRE>
	<B>http</B>://www.w3.org
	<B>ftp</B>://ftp.w3.org
	etc.
</PRE>
<P>
The <A HREF="../Using/Methods.html">User's Guide</A> describes in detail
how you can set up the protocol modules in your application.

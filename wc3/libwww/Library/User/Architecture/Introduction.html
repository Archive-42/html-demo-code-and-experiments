  Introduction
</H1>
<P>
Libwww is a general code base that can be used as a basis for building a
large variety of World Wide Web applications. Its main purpose is to provide
services to transmit data objects rendered in many different media types
either to or from a remote server using the most common Internet access methods
or the local file system. It provides plain C reference implementations of
those specifications and is especially designed to be used on a large set
of different platforms. Version 3.1 supports more than 20 Unix flavors, VMS,
Windows NT, and ongoing work is being done to extend the set of platforms.
<P>
Even though plain C does not support an object oriented model but merely
enables the concept, many of the data structures in the Library are derived
from the class notation. This leads to situations where forced type casting
is required in order to use a reference to a subclass where a superclass
is expected. The forced type casting problem and inheritance in general would
be solved if an object oriented programming language was to be used instead
of C, but the current standardization and deployment level of object oriented
languages in general would imply that a part of the portability would get
lost in the transition. There are several intermediate solutions under
consideration where one or more object oriented APIs built on top of the
Library provides the application programmer with a cleaner interface.
<P>
Many of the features of libwww are demonstrated in the
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> which is a text terminal
client built right on top of the Library. Even though this application is
usable as an independent Web application, its main purpose is to show a working
example of how libwww can be used. However, it is important to note that
the Line Mode Browser is only <EM>one</EM> way of using libwww and many other
applications may want to use it in other ways.
<P>
The development of libwww was started by
<A HREF="../../../People.html#BernersLee">Tim Berners-Lee</A> in 1990, and
today the Library is a multi functional code base with a large amount of
knowledge about network programming and portability built into it with help
from <A HREF="../../../People.html#Luotonen">Ari Luotonen</A>,
<A HREF="../../../People.html#Groff">Jean-Francois Groff</A>,
<A HREF="../../../People/howcome/">H&aring;kon W. Lie</A> and a large number
of people on the Internet.

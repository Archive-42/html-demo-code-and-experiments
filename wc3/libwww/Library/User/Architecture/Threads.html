  The Net Class
</H1>
<P>
In a single-process, single threaded environment all requests to, for example,
the I/O interface blocks any further progress in the process. Any combination
of a multiprocess or multi threaded implementation of the Library makes provision
for the application to request several independent documents at the same
time without getting blocked by slow I/O operations. As a Web application
is expected to use much of the time doing I/O such as "connect" and "read",
a high degree of optimization can be obtained if multiple threads can run
at the same time.
<P>
The Net class manages information related to a "thread" in libwww. As libwww
threads are not really threads but a notion of using interleaved, non-blocking
I/O for accessing data objects from the network (or local file system), they
can be used on any platform with or without support for native threads. In
the case where you have an application using real threads the Net class is
simply a object maintaining links to all other objects involved in serving
the request. If you are using the libwww pseudo threads then the Net object
contains enough information to stop and start a request based on which BSD
sockets are ready. In practise this is of course transparent to the application
- this is just to explain the difference.
<P>
As libwww threads are not really threads but a notion of using non-blocking
I/O for accessing data objects from the network (or local file system), it
can be used on any number of platforms with or without native support for
threads, and this section describes the model behind libwww threads and how
it affects applications.
<H2>
  The Net object
</H2>
<P>
The <EM>Net object</EM> contains all the state information required to stop
and start execute a request using asynchronous IO. The use of asynchronous
IO has an important implication on the implementation of the access modules
in the Library, for example the HTTP module which is explained later:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Global variables can be used only if they at all time are independent of
    the current state of the active Net object.
  <LI>
    Automatic variables can be used only if they are initialized on every entry
    to the function and stay state independent of the current request throughout
    their lifetime.
  <LI>
    All information necessary for completing a request must be kept in an autonomous
    data object that is passed round the via the stack.
</UL>
<P>

<P>
The main reason for keeping the Net object separate from the Request object
is that some requests require more than one Net object, for example FTP which
has a Net object for the control TCP connection and a Net object for each
data TCP connection. In the case of HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0, there is a 1:1
correspondence between a Net object and a request object. In HTTP/1.1 a Net
object can live longer than a single request as persistent connections might
handle a set of requests over the same TCP socket. Net objects can be used
in three different ways:
<OL>
  <LI>
    All requests are preemptive and all I/O is blocking
  <LI>
    Requests are non-preemptive managed by an <EM>internal</EM> event loop
  <LI>
    Requests are non-preemptive managed by an <EM>external</EM> event loop
</OL>
<P>
The three modes are described in more detail in the section on
<A HREF="Events.html">Internal and External Events</A>. In mode 2) the Net
objects is used to make the binding between the socket based internal event
loop (using a <CODE>select()</CODE> call) and a request, so that a socket
ready for an I/O action can make the corresponding libwww thread active.
In mode 1) and 3) Net objects represents the socket interface of a request.
<H2>
  Creation and Termination of a Net object
</H2>
<P>
A Net object is created by the Net manager from within the Request manager
every time a request is passed to the Library. A request can either be issued
by the application or the Library itself for example as a result of redirection,
access authentication, or when a new data connection is created in a FTP
request. All new Net objects are automatically associated with a group which
might already exist or be created together with the new Net object.
<P>
When a Net object has been created, the Request manager returns immediately
to the caller and does not see the request before it has terminated either
with a success or an error as result. The request can either be started
immediately by the Net manager or put into a queue if the maximum number
of open TCP connections is reached. When a request is terminated there are
typically a set of tasks that the application would like to do:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Update the history list
  <LI>
    Report the result to the log manager
  <LI>
    Update the display
  <LI>
    etc.
</UL>
<P>
Handling the termination of a request is based on call back functions that
can be registered in the Net manager dynamically at run time. Multiple call
back functions can be registered in which case they are all called from the
Net manager in the sequence they were registered. As an example, the Request
manager registers a call back function to handle the status of the request
regarding to some internal actions. This function is registered at initialization
time of the Library. The application can add its own call back functions
to be called on termination of a request.

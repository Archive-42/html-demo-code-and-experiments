  Libwww Architecture
</H1>
<p>Libwww is a general code base that can be used as a basis for
building Web client applications. Its main purpose is to provide
services to transmit data rendered in many different media types
either to or from a remote server using the most common Internet
access methods (HTTP, FTP, Gopher, etc.) or the local file system.</p>

<p>It is written in plain C intended to work on <a
href="../Platform/">most Unix, Windows, and possibly Mac</a></p>

<p>Even though plain C does not support an object oriented model but
merely enables the concept, many of the data structures in libwww are
<a href="../Style/Cpp.html">derived from the class notation</a>. This
leads to situations where forced type casting is required in order to
use a reference to a subclass where a superclass is expected. The
forced type casting problem and inheritance in general would be solved
if an object oriented programming language was to be used instead of
C, but the current standardization and deployment level of object
oriented languages in general would imply that a part of the
portability would get lost in the transition.</p>

<p>Many of the features of libwww are demonstrated in the
<A HREF="../../Examples/">sample applications</A></p>

<P>The development of libwww was started by
<A HREF="../../../People.html#BernersLee">Tim Berners-Lee</A> in 1990, and
today the Library is a multi functional code base with a large amount of
knowledge about network programming and portability built into it with help
from <A HREF="../../../People.html#Luotonen">Ari Luotonen</A>,
<A HREF="../../../People.html#Groff">Jean-Francois Groff</A>,
<A HREF="../../../People/howcome/">H&aring;kon W. Lie</A> and a large number
of people on the Internet.

  Design of Libwww Core
</H2>
<P>
This section describes some of the design points behind the libwww core.
The core is basically a registry where the application can register the set
of features that the application needs.

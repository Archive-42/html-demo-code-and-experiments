  The Anchor Class
</H1>
<P>
The <A HREF="../../src/HTAnchor.html">Anchor Class</A> defines references
to data objects which may be the sources or destinations of hypertext links.
Another name for anchors would be URLs as an anchor represents all we know
about a URL - including where it points to and who points to it.
<P>
The anchors are organized into a <EM>sub-web</EM> which represents the part
of the web that the application (often the user) has been in touch with.
In this sub-web, any anchor can be the source of zero, one, or many links
and it may be the destination of zero, one, or many links. That is, any anchor
can point to and be pointed to by any number of links. Having an anchor being
the source of many links is often used in the <B>POST</B> method, where for
example the same entity can be posted to a News group, a mailing list and
a HTTP server. This is explained in the section on
<A HREF="PostWeb.html">libwww PostWebs</A>.
<P>
All URLs are represented as anchors. An anchor contains all the information
that we know about a particular URL - including &nbsp;the entity body if
we happen to have down loaded the entity. As anchors often exist throughout
the lifetime of the application, we must be able to flush the entity
bodies&nbsp;from time to time so that we don't overflow the memory. Therefore,
it is possible to have an anchor both with and without an entity body. If
the data object is stored in the file cache or in memory, the parent anchor
contains a link to it so the application can access it either directly or
through the <A HREF="./#ClientCache">file cache manager</A>.
<P>
Just to make things a bit more complicated, we have two different sub classes
of the Anchor class:
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <EM>parent anchors</EM>
  <DD>
    Represents a complete URL. That is, the destination of a link pointing to
    a parent anchor is the full contents of that URL. Parent anchors are used
    to store all information about a URL, for example the content type, language,
    and length.
  <DT>
    <EM>child anchors</EM>
  <DD>
    Represents a subpart of a URL. A subpart is declared by making a
    <CODE>NAME</CODE> tag in the anchor declaration and a child anchor is the
    destination of a link if the <CODE>HREF</CODE> link declaration contains
    a <CODE>"#"</CODE> and a tag appended to the URI. Child anchors do <I>not</I>
    contain any information about the data object itself. They only keep a handle
    (or a "<CODE>tag</CODE>") pointing into the data object kept by the corresponding
    parent anchor.
</DL>
<P>
Every parent anchor points to a URL address which may or may not exist. In
the case of posting an anchor to a remote server, the URL pointed to is yet
to be created. The client can assign an address for the object but it might
be overridden (or completely denied) by the remote server. The relationship
between parent anchors and child anchors is illustrated in the figure.

  <LI>
    Parent anchors keep a list of its children which is used to avoid having
    multiple example of the same child and in the garbage collection of anchors.
  <LI>
    All child anchors have a pointer to their parent as only the parent anchors
    keep information about the data object itself. Parent anchors simply have
    a pointer to themselves.
  <LI>
    Every parent anchor points to a resource (URL) that may or may not exist.
  <LI>
    Parents can have an entity body associated with them. In this case anchor
    <B>B</B> and <B>C</B> has an entity body (data object) but <B>A</B> hasn't
    which can either be because the anchor has not yet been down loaded <I>or</I>
    the entity body has been discarded from memory by the application.
  <LI>
    Any anchor can have any number of links pointing to a set of destinations
    (URLs).This is a generalization of the normal URL concept that a URL is only
    pointing to a single location, and in most situations there <I>is</I> only
    one destination. However, &nbsp;multiple destinations can occur&nbsp;when
    posting entities to multiple remote servers at the same time.
  <LI>
    This anchor has two destinations (parent anchors which each have a URL).
    By default the main destination will be the one selected.
  <LI>
    Parent anchors keep a list of other anchors pointing to it. This information
    is required if a single parent anchor (and its children) is removed from
    the sub-web.

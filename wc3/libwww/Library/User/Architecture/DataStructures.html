  Core Classes and APIs
</H1>
<P>
The Library Core contains a set of objects central to the Library. Each of
the core modules as explained in section "<A HREF="ControlFlow.html">Control
and Data Flow</A>"are relying on one or more of these objects. This section
describes the relationship between the core modules, the core objects
<EM>and</EM> the relationship between the core objects themselves.
<P>
The figure below is very similar to the one in section
"<A HREF="ControlFlow.html">Control and Data Flow</A>", but it also introduces
the core objects associated.

    <A NAME="request" HREF="../../src/HTReq.html">HTRequest</A>
  <DD>
    The <EM>HTRequest</EM> object contains information necessary to handle a
    request issued by the application. It contains information about the method
    to be used (for example "GET" and "PUT"), user preferences (language, content
    type etc.) specific for this request, where the output of the data object
    should go etc. A HTRequest object exists until the request reaches a final
    state, either success or failure, after which it can be discarded. Normally,
    a HTRequest object is created by the application, but the Library is capable
    of creating them on its own under certain circumstances. An example is when
    the Library creates a "Post Web" as explained in section
    "<A HREF="PostWeb.html">Building a POST Web, an API for PUT and POST</A>".

    <IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="A" ALT="A">
    <A NAME="anchor" HREF="../../src/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor</A>
  <DD>
    <EM>HTAnchor</EM> objects represent any document which may be the source
    or destination of hypertext links. The HTAnchor object contains all information
    about the object, whether it has been loaded, metainformation like language,
    media type etc., and any relations to other objects. The Library defines
    two anchor classes: a parent anchor and a child anchor. The former contains
    information about whole data objects and the latter contains about subparts
    of a data object. The HTAnchor object is a generic superclass of both parent
    anchors and child anchors. Section "<A HREF="Anchors.html">Anchor Objects</A>"
    describes anchors and their relations in more detail.

    <IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="N" ALT="N">
    <A NAME="net" HREF="../../src/HTNet.html">HTNet</A>
  <DD>
    The <EM>HTNet</EM> is a network object which contains all information required
    to read and write from the network. It contains the current socket descriptor
    (or ANSI C file descriptor) used for reading and writing, which input buffer
    to use and where to put the data once they are read. It also contains timing
    information on how long it takes to connect to a remote host and how many
    times it has tried to connect. This information is used by the
    <A HREF="DNSCache.html">DNS Cache</A> in order to optimize access on multi
    homed hosts. The HTNet object is also a key element in the libwww thread
    model where it is used to identify a "thread". The libwww thread model is
    explained in "<A HREF="Threads.html">Description of libwww Threads</A>".
  <DT>
    <IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="E" ALT="E">
    <A NAME="error" HREF="../../src/HTError.html">HTError</A>
  <DD>
    The <EM>HTError</EM> object contains information about errors occured along
    the way when a request is handled by the Library. Errors can be nested and
    the object is independent of the natural langue used to pass information
    to the User. The definition of the messages may be handled by the application
    - or it can ignore it all together.
  <DT>
    <IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="S" ALT="S">
    <A NAME="stream" HREF="../../src/HTStream.html">HTStream</A>
  <DD>
    The <A HREF="../../src/HTStream.html">stream</A> object accepts sequences
    of characters. It is a destination of data which can be thought of much like
    an output stream in C++ or an ANSI C-file stream for writing data to a disk
    or another peripheral device. The broad definition makes streams very flexible
    and they are used as the main method to transport data from the application
    to the network and vise versa. The Library defines two stream classes: A
    generic stream class and a specialized stream class for structured data using
    SGML lexical tokens. The contents of the two classes is described in detail
    in section "<A HREF="Streams.html">Streams Objects</A>".

The following figure illustrates the relations between the core objects
themselves.

  <LI>
    When an application issues a request the access manager binds the anchor
    corresponding to a URL together with a request object. The binding exists
    until the request reaches a final state after which the application can discard
    the request object. Normally the anchor object stays in memory during the
    whole life time of the application as the set of anchors represent the part
    of the Web that the application has been in touch with including metainformation
    etc.
  <LI>
    The application can make a binding between the request object and the desired
    destination for the data when it arrives, typically from the network. The
    request object is by default bound to a
    <A HREF="../../src/HTML.html">presentation stream</A> which presents a hypertext
    object to the user on the screen, but it can also be written to a file,
    represented as source text etc.
  <LI>
    If the file cache is enabled a cache object is created and linked to the
    anchor object by the cache manager so that the access manager on any future
    requests can use the cached version (if not stale). As mentioned, the cache
    manager is yet to be fully designed, and the current approach may change.
  <LI>
    If the data object is not found in the cache or in memory the protocol manager
    is called by the access manager. The protocol manager then executes a specific
    protocol module which creates a HTNet object and binds it to the request
    object. The HTNet object is maintained uniquely by the protocol module and
    is removed by the protocol module as soon as the communication with the remote
    server reaches a final state.
  <LI>
    The request object also has a link to any error information related to it.
    At the end of the request this information is handled by the error manager
    and an error message may be generated and passed to the user.
  <LI>
    When data starts arriving, typically from the network, it is directed down
    the stream chain which can either already exist or is created as data arrives
    (stream chains are described in the section "<A HREF="Streams.html">Stream
    Objects</A>". In the case where the application is transmitting a data object
    to a remote server, there are two steam chains directed in opposite directions:
    one from the application to the network and one from the network to the
    application.
  <LI>
    The end of the stream chain is the stream that the user may have defined
    when the request first was issued or it can be the default destination which
    is presenting the information on the screen. Between the first and the last
    stream in the stream chain there can be any number of other stream objects
    performing operations either directly on the data, or on the stream flow
    itself. A T-stream is an example of the latter where the stream flow is divided
    into two.
  <LI>
    The application receives the data arriving from the network via the "HText"
    object (or any of the other stream interfaces as explained in section
    <A HREF="../Using/HTML.html">The HTML Parser</A> in the User's Guide).

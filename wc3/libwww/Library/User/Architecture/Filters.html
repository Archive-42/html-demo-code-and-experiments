  Before and After Filters
</H1>
<P>
Filters are called <I>before</I> a request is to be issued to the Network,
and <I>after</I> when the request has terminated. &nbsp;All filters are
registered at run-time, and filters can be cascaded so that one filter can
call other filters and so on. Filters can also start new requests or terminate
existing requests, so the set of possibilities is very big. Normally, filters
do only handle metainformation about a resource. For example, the authentication
filters looks to see if we have been asked to provide some credentials in
order to access a URL. If so then it adds a protocol defined header to the
request, and if not then the request just proceeds. Handling the actual data
object is done by <A HREF="../Using/Streams.html">streams</A> which can
&nbsp;modify the contents of a data object.
<P>
The Library can handle local and global filters - local filters are associated
with a single request and global filters are associated with all requests.
That is, if you can decorate a request with a specialized filter or you can
use a generalized filter for handling all requests. A global filter is useful
if the filter is to be performed very often and local filters can either
add to or override the global set of filters.
<P>
Often, a before and an after filter needs to share a context which is unique
to this set of filters. There are various ways this can be handled by the
Library. Either a context can associated at registration time or it can be
built while the filters are run. The <A HREF="../../src/HTUTree.html">URL
tree</A> is a useful data object for keeping information associated with
realms or sets of URLs.

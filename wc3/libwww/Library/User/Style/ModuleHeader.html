  Libwww Modules and Documentation
</H1>
<P>
A libwww module consists of the following:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A module definition file, for example <EM>foo.c</EM>
  <LI>
    A module declaration file, for example <EM>foo.h</EM>
  <LI>
    A module description file, for example <EM>foo.html</EM>
</UL>
<P>
Even though ANSI C doesn't support classes or objects, it is an advantage
- especially when more and more people are going to contribute with modules
that each module is a self-contained unit with a clearly defined interface
to the rest of the world. It is important that you supply a lot of "methods"
for accessing the data structures and only declare as little
<CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> as possible of the internal structures.
<P>
Make sure that your file names are not <B>longer than 8 characters</B> as
we support PCs as well. The declaration file is generated
<B>automatically</B> from the description file using the
<A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode browser</A>. This ensures that the
description of a module is done at the same time as the declaration of the
module. The generation of the declaration files is done at compile time using
the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>, so be sure that you
have a recent version of this.
<P>
All documentation is written in HTML so that we can use hypertext links.
To prevent the low level documentation from getting out of sync with the
code, the .h files are extracted from the .html files. While this is only
effective for API function documentation, it is better than nothing.
<P>
The module header is the comment at the top of a definition file and description
file. Please remember to fill it out carefully! The misterious line <CODE>@(#)
$Id$</CODE> makes
CVS add the version information automatically. Just write it as is and CVS
will do the rest.

  Function Declarations
</H1>
<P>
External functions are declared in include files. There are three kinds of
include files:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Application include files
  <LI>
    Library include files
  <LI>
    System include files and standard C include files
</UL>
<H2>
  Application Include Files
</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>.c</CODE> file should <CODE>#include</CODE> its own <CODE>.h</CODE>
file. A .h file should be protected so that no errors occur if it is #include'd
twice. This can be done by the following directives:
<PRE>
	#ifndef HTFOO_H
	#define HTFOO_H

	All the stuff

	#endif /* HTFOO_H */
</PRE>
<P>
An interface which relies on other interfaces should include those interface
files. An implementation file which uses other modules should include the
.h file if it not already included by its own .h file.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/warning" ALT="WARNING" BORDER="0"> The text
format in description files which are converted into declaration files <EM>MUST
NOT</EM> be more than 90 characters wide - otherwise it will get chopped
off by the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> the way the
conversion currently is set up.
<H2>
  Library Include Files
</H2>
<P>
If you are making a <A HREF="../../">Library</A> module then you need to
include all the modules that you reference in your code. You will in all
cases need the following:
<PRE>
	#include "wwwsys.h"
	#include "WWWUtil.h"
</PRE>
<P>
If you are <B>not</B> making a Library module, then you need the following:
<PRE>	#include "wwwsys.h"
	#include "WWWLib.h"
</PRE>
<H2>
  System include files and standard C include files
</H2>
<P>
As these are <A HREF="../../src/wwwsys.html">included in the libwww code</A>
then do not include any system header files directly. The reason is that
these include files are very difficult to get portable over multiple platforms.

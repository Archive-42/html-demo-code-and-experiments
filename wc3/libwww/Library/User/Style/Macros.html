  PRIVATE and PUBLIC Macros
</H1>
<P>
All functions and global data are prepended with either <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE>
or <CODE>PRIVATE</CODE>. These macros are defined in
<A HREF="../../src/HTUtils.html#declaration" NAME="7">HTUtils.html</A>. In
practice <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> is defined to nothing and <CODE>PRIVATE</CODE>
is <CODE>static</CODE>. These tags are also useful for scripts that search
the code for functions (e.g.
<A HREF="../../../config/makedefs.pl" NAME="8">makedefs</A>).
<H2>
  <A NAME="PRIVATE">PRIVATE</A>
</H2>
<P>
It is used in a function or variable declaration to signify that the function
is private to the module, rather than public (the default). Avoids the confusion
in C between "<CODE>static</CODE>" used in this sense, and used to declare
storage variables within blocks as static as opposed to automatic.
<H2>
  <A NAME=z14>PUBLIC</A>
</H2>
<P>
It is used to signify that a function is part of the public interface. As
this macro is used in windows to generate DLLs it is <EM>very</EM> important
that you use it! It also is a good idea to use simply because it ensures
that the programmer has thought about it. This prevents unnecessary accidental
public definitions which may later clash with other people's routines.

  C++ in C
</H1>
<P>
C is much more widely supported than C++. There is a subset of C++ that is
common to all C++ compilers but it can be emulated in C with minimal loss
in efficiency or readability. This subset includes
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A NAME=2 HREF="#construction">construction/destruction</A>
  <LI>
    <A NAME="3" HREF="#Hiding">data hiding</A>
  <LI>
    <A NAME="4" HREF="#Name">name spaces</A>
  <LI>
    <A NAME=5 HREF="#thisPointer">this pointer</A>
  <LI>
    <A NAME=6 HREF="#inheritance">inheritance</A>
</UL>
<P>
While the C++ in C approach is not perfect, it does allow much greater
portability.
<H2>
  <A NAME="construction">Construction / Destruction</A>
</H2>
<P>
C++ provides language primitives for memory allocation (<CODE>new</CODE>)
and freeing (<CODE>free</CODE>). These functions call the
<CODE>constructor</CODE> and <CODE>destructor</CODE> for an object. The libwww
implements this in C with <I>object</I>_<CODE>new</CODE> and
<I>object</I>_<CODE>delete</CODE>. For example:
<PRE>	PUBLIC HTRequest * HTRequest_new (void)
	{
	    HTRequest * me;
	    if ((me = (HTRequest *) HT_CALLOC(1, sizeof(HTRequest))) == NULL)
	        HT_OUTOFMEM("HTRequest_new()");
    
	   /* Force Reload */
	    me-&gt;reload = HT_ANY_VERSION;
	.
	.
	.
	    me-&gt;ContentNegotiation = NO;		       /* Do this by default */

	#ifdef WWW_WIN_ASYNC
	    HTEvent_winHandle(me);
	#endif
	    return me;
	}
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Hiding">Data Hiding</A>
</H2>
<P>
Many classes are defined in C++ to be private, meaning that all manipulation
of the object is done through member functions (methods). Any attempt at
meddling with the contents by an outside function will result in a compiler
error. Object data is protected in libwww by declaring a structure in a header
file, but not defining it. That is, the object is <I>opaque</I> to the
application - exactly like the ANSI C <CODE>FILE</CODE> object.
<PRE>
	typedef struct _MyObject MyObject;

	int MyObject_saveTheWorld(MyObject * me);
</PRE>
<P>
The method (<CODE>saveTheWorld</CODE>) is accessible to everyone including
the header, but the contents of a <CODE>MyObject</CODE> are not. Only the
module containing <CODE>MyObject</CODE>'s methods has a definition of the
object,
<PRE>	struct _MyObject {
	    int someInt;
	};
</PRE>
<P>
and therefore, access to the contents (<CODE>someInt</CODE>);
<H2>
  <A NAME="Name">Name spaces</A>
</H2>
<P>
Most C++ objects come with a set of methods (member functions) which are
<A NAME=5 HREF="#dataHiding">permitted</A> to affect the object. Any operation
performed on an object (<CODE>myObject-&gt;saveTheWorld</CODE>) will be performed
by an method in that object's class.
<PRE>	class MyObject {
	private:         // data
	    int someInt;
	public:          // methods
	    int saveTheWorld(void);
	}
	main ()
	{
	  MyObject * myObject = new MyObject;
	  myObject-&gt;saveTheWorld();
	}
</PRE>
<P>
What is actually happening is that the compiler is generating a name from
the class name and the method name, e.g..
<CODE>_@MyObject@@saveTheWord@132</CODE>. This is done explicitly in libwww,
e.g. <CODE>MyObject_saveTheWorld.</CODE>While more verbose, this does, at
least, eliminate the awkward hunt to figure out what instance of a method
the compiler used.
<H2>
  "this" pointer
</H2>
<P>
The this pointer is simply an understood first parameter to any method. libwww
includes all parameters explicitly.
<PRE>	<CODE>C++:</CODE>	myObject-&gt;saveTheWorld();
</PRE>
<P>
is equivalent to
<PRE>	<CODE>libwww:</CODE>	MyObject_saveTheWorld(myObject);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Inheritance
</H2>
<P>
In C++, classes may be derived from other classes.
<PRE>	class MyOtherObject: public MyObject {
	private:         // data
	    int anotherInt;
	public:          // methods
	    int saveTheWales(void);
	};
</PRE>
<P>
As far as memory is concerned, this is identical to
<PRE>	struct _MyOtherObject {
	    MyObject base;
	    int anotherInt;
	};
</PRE>
<P>
but one problem remains. In C++, all the instances of
<CODE>MyOtherObject</CODE> may call
<CODE>myOtherObject-&gt;saveTheWales()</CODE> as well as
<CODE>myOtherObject-&gt;saveTheWorld()</CODE>. The compiler knows that a
pointer to a <CODE>MyOtherObject</CODE> also points to a
<CODE>MyObject</CODE>, so <CODE>saveTheWorld</CODE> may be called with the
same pointer as <CODE>saveTheWales</CODE>. This is much trickier than the
others as it requires more logic on the part of the compiler.
<P>
In libwww, this is mostly handled through explicit pointer casting. &nbsp;As
an example, an <A HREF="../../src/HTStream.html">HTStream class</A> always
includes an <CODE>HTStreamClass</CODE> as the first element (normally called
<CODE>isa</CODE>). This way, the <I>local</I> definition of the
<A HREF="../../src/HTStream.html">HTStream</A> may vary from module to module,
depending on what context is needed to process the stream, but the library
can use the standard <CODE>HTStreamClass</CODE> functions to supply it with
data.

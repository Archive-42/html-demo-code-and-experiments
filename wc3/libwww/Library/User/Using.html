  How to get Started Writing an App
</H1>
<P>
This note explains the overall moves to make when you are writing an application
on top of the W3C Sample Code Library (libwww). For details on how to use the
library, you should look at the <A HREF="Using/">User's Guide</A>.

  Define preferences and application capabilities
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/HTInit.html">HTInit module</A> is a special module in
that it defines the capabilities of the Library. Think of libwww as a core
that can do absolutely nothing on its own. All the functionality comes from
modules that are registered dynamically at runtime. This is why it is so
important to use the initialization function mentioned above. The library
basically boot-straps itself to find out what it is capable of doing.
<P>
When you unpack the library you already have a lot of functionality to plug
in. You have protocol modules that can access HTTP, FTP, Gopher, WAIS, NNTP,
Telnet, TN3270, rlogin, services and the local file system. You also have
stream <EM>converters</EM> that handles HTML documents, plain text documents,
MIME documents and various conversions between these data formats. Furthermore
you have the possibility of defining <EM>presenters</EM> that use external
viewers to present for example images, audio files etc.
<P>
By default, the <A HREF="../src/HTInit.html">HTInit module</A> contains functions
to enable all the functionality that the library provides, but you might
want to change this, for example if you have a special image viewer that
you would like to use. The way to do this is either to modify the HTInit
module or to override HTInit with your own version. It's described in more
detail in the <A HREF="./">User's Guide</A> what it means to override a Library
module.
<P>
Both converters and presenters are stored in a linked list (the
<A HREF="../src/HTList.html">HTList object</A>). This list can either be
bound to a global list of converters and presenters that are used in
<EM>all</EM> requests or you can bind the lists locally to a single request
object in which case it is only used in this particular case.
<H3>
  Data Format Conversions
</H3>
<P>
<EM>Converters</EM> are streams that are capable of converting directly from
one data format to another, for example from a HTML document to some kind
of presentation format that the user can actually see on the screen. This
is the fastest way of presenting an object to the user as it doesn't require
external applications to step in and do the presentation.
<PRE>
extern void HTConverterInit (HTList * conversions);
</PRE>
<H3>
  External Presenters
</H3>
<P>
<EM>Presenters</EM> are used to present a data format to the user by calling
an external program, for example a post script viewer. In practice presenters
work by first saving the data object in local file and then spawn off the
external viewer. This is the reason why it is a big advantage to use a converter
instead as the presentation to the user then can happen as more and more
of the data object arrives over the network.
<PRE>
extern void HTPresenterInit (HTList * conversions);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Protocol Modules
</H3>
<P>
By default the Library enables all available protocol modules but if this
is desired then it can easily be changed using the <CODE>HTProtocolInit</CODE>
function. An example is if you want to make an application that only can
speak HTTP, then you can disable the initialization of all the other protocol
modules by simply taking them out of the <CODE>HTProtocolInit</CODE> function.
<PRE>
extern void HTProtocolInit (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Binding File Suffixes and Data Formats
</H2>
<P>
Not all protocols support the notion of describing the data format of a data
object. An example if FTP where only two modes are possible: text and binary.
However this is not sufficient in order to select an appropriate converter
of presenter (both images and audio files are binary data object but can
in general not be handled by the same application). This is also a problem
when accessing the local file system which in most cases do not keep information
about the data format.
<P>
The library solves this by looking into a table of bindings between a file
suffix and the corresponding data format. By default the Library defines
a long list of the "most common file suffixes" but the list is of course
configurable! If you look into the <A HREF="../src/HTInit.html">HTInit
module</A> again, you will find a function called:
<PRE>
extern void HTFileInit (void);
</PRE>
<P>
you will find that it is just a question of adding new suffixes that are
not mentioned. However, it is not necessary to list all possible suffixes.
Luckily the first couple of line in many data objects tell what kind of data
they contain and the Library uses this to try and guess unknown data formats.
<A NAME="sgml"></A>
<H2>
  Should I use the Internal SGML/HTML Parse Stream?
</H2>
<P>
The library contains code for presenting a data object in a text based
application as is the case with the Line Mode Browser, but as this is not
generally sufficient GUI clients must overwrite the data object presentation
modules in the Library in order to take advantage of a more advanced
user-interface. Just to make it more flexible this can be done in three ways
depending on how much you want to do yourself. The three interfaces are
illustrated below:
<P>
<IMG BORDER="0" SRC="Guide/Interfaces.gif" ALT="Interfaces" WIDTH="431" HEIGHT="319">
<P>
<DL>
  <DT>
    SGML Stream Interface
  <DD>
    Use this interface if you do not want to use the
    <A HREF="../src/SGML.html">SGML parser</A> in the Library and the following
    transition to a structured stream which is a subclass of the stream class.
    This can all be set up with out overwriting any module but simply by defining
    the converters not to use the SGML/HTML parsers.
  <DT>
    HTML Structured Stream Interface
  <DD>
    If the client has its own HTML parser then the interface is between the client
    HTML parser and the Library SGML parser. The SGML parser is a general SGML
    parser which can be setup with a specific DTD and it feeds the HTML parser
    with structured data. In this case, you will be emulating the
    <A HREF="../src/HTML.c">HTML module</A>, and generating a hypertext object
    from the structured stream.
  <DT>
    HText Call Back Interface
  <DD>
    If the client wants to use the HTML parser in the Library then this is the
    interface to use for the application. The hypertext object is parsed and
    the communication with the client is based on a set of call-back functions
    in the HTML parser. The call-back functions are all defined as prototypes
    in the <A HREF="../src/HText.html">HText module</A> but the client must provide
    the actual code that defines the presentation method used for a specific
    HTML tag. If you wish to maintain the structure of the SGML file within your
    object, then the SGML interface will be a better place to connect your code.
</DL>
<P>
You are free to define the structure of the hypertext object (the declaration
can be found in the <A HREF="../src/HText.html">HText module</A>. You may
want to define your own styles and font definitions.
<H2>
  Register a memory cache handler
</H2>
<P>
The library handles a persistent file cache which provides intermediate term
storage of cacheable objects. However the Library also has a notion of a
memory cache but this is <EM>not</EM> maintained by the Library itself but
by the application. The reason for this is that the Library does not know
what kind of data format the the application is capable of storing or where
they are stored, and it also allows the application to control the memory
management, that is how much space to use for storing data objects in memory.
<P>
If the application wants a memory cache (which has an important performance
impact) it must register a memory cache handler that can make a decision
whether a data object is in memory or not and if it is stale or not. Every
URL has an associated <A HREF="../src/HTAnchor.html">HTAnchor object</A>
that stores all known information about that URL, for example the title,
length of the data object (if any) etc. The Library calls the memory handler
on every request but before making a decision about a data object, the memory
cache manager can consult the requested anchor object to find out if it has
expired etc. A memory handler is registered and unregistered using the functions
<PRE>
typedef int HTMemoryCacheHandler	(HTRequest * request, HTExpiresMode mode, char * message);
extern BOOL HTMemoryCache_register	(HTMemoryCacheHandler * cbf);
extern BOOL HTMemoryCache_unRegister	(void);
</PRE>
<P>
The handler can use two return codes which both are defined in the
<A HREF="../src/HTUtils.html">HTUtils modules</A>.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_LOADED</CODE>
  <DD>
    If the object was found and looked good
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_ERROR</CODE>
  <DD>
    If the object was not found, has expired etc.
</DL>
<P>
An example of a memory handler can be found in the <A HREF="../../LineMode/">
Line Mode Browser</A> in the <A HREF="../../LineMode/src/GridText.c">GridText
module</A>. You can also see where it is registered as <EM>the</EM> memory
handler in the Library in the
<A HREF="../../LineMode/src/HTBrowse.c">HTBrowse.c module</A>
<A NAME="eh"></A>
<H2>
  Register event handlers for user input
</H2>
<P>
The Library has a very flexible event model that allows an application to
either use it's own event loop that the library can makes calls to or to
use the event loop in the <A HREF="../src/HTEvent.html">HTEvent module</A>
in the library. In most cases the library event loop is sufficient which
is the case for example on Mac, Window, and Unix platforms.
<P>
The application can register as many event handlers for as many channels
that it can get input on. In the case of the Line Mode Browser, input can
only be sent via standard input, so only one event handler is necessary.
However if more than one channel is available then they can all be associated
with an event handler by registering them in the Library. An event handler
is a function of the type
<PRE>
typedef int HTEventCallBack (SOCKET sockfd, HTRequest * request, SockOps ops);
</PRE>
<P>
and they can be registered in two ways depending on the event channel:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The event channel can be redirected to a BSD socket
  <LI>
    The event channel is connected to a TTY console (for example under NT)
</UL>
<P>
In the first case use the following functions to register and unregister
a handler:
<PRE>
extern int HTEvent_Register	(SOCKET sockfd, HTRequest * request, SockOps ops,
				 HTEventCallBack *cbf, HTPriority priority);
extern int HTEvent_UnRegister	(SOCKET sockfd, SockOps ops);
</PRE>
<P>
See the <A HREF="../src/HTEvent.html">HTEvent module</A> for more information
on the arguments. Likewise if you are on for example a Windows NT platform
then use the following functions:
<PRE>
extern int HTEvent_RegisterTTY	(SOCKET sockfd, HTRequest * request, SockOps ops,
				 HTEventCallBack *cbf, HTPriority priority);
extern int HTEvent_UnRegisterTTY(SOCKET sockfd, SockOps ops);
</PRE>
<P>
The return code from an event handler is simple but very important. There
are two allowed values:
<DL>
  <DT>
    HT_OK
  <DD>
    If the handler could handle the event
  <DT>
    HT_ERROR
  <DD>
    If an <EM>internal</EM> error occured, for example a NULL argument was passed
    etc. This code will result in that the event loop is exit'ed and the application
    is ready to be terminated.
</DL>
<P>
It helps understanding event handlers if you think of the Library as a coke
machine (the ones with a coin slot only - the ones which also has a bill
slot work differently!) Event handlers are the coin slot on top where you
can request a service from the library. You are guaranteed that the machine
never returns any coins to you the same way - they always come out at the
bottom of the machine. This means that the Library always returns "Thanks,
I have received your request - please look for the response at the bottom"
on any request started from within an event handler. In the library case
the result is always returned in the request termination handler that is
the "bottom" of the Library machine. <A NAME="rt"></A>
<H2>
  Register a request termination handler
</H2>
<P>
The application can register a callback function that is called whenever
a request has terminated, regardless. The callback function can furthermore
be registered to be called regardless of the status code or on upon a specific
codes. The set of status codes is:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_LOADED</CODE>
  <DD>
    The request was successful
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_INTERRUPTED</CODE>
  <DD>
    The request was interrupted
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_ERROR</CODE>
  <DD>
    An error occured
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_NO_DATA</CODE>
  <DD>
    The request resulted in an object with no data, for example a telnet session
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_RETRY</CODE>
  <DD>
    The service was unavailable but the request can be repeated at at later time.
    This later time can be obtained using the function
    <PRE>
extern time_t HTRequest_retryTime (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
</DL>
<P>
Return codes are <EM>not</EM> used from termination handlers.
<A NAME="mime"></A>
<H2>
  Register an "Unknown Header" Handler
</H2>
<P>
If you have additional headers that you want to experiment with you can register
a header parser to handle all unknown headers. This handler is called whenever
an unknown header is encountered when parsing the object header. If the returns
YES then the MIME parser stores the metainformation in the anchor object
if self so that it can be found at a later point in time. If the handler
returns NO, then the header is discarded.
<P>
The header passed to the call back function will be in normal NULL terminated
C string without any CRLF. The line will also be unwrapped so that it is
easier to parse for the call back function.
<PRE>
typedef int HTMIMEHandler	(HTRequest * request, char * header);

extern int HTMIME_register	(HTMIMEHandler * cbf);
extern int HTMIME_unRegister	(void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Register a Select Timeout Function
</H2>
<P>
You can register a call back function together with a timeout that is used
in the select call of the <A HREF="../src/HTEvent.html">event loop</A>. When
the select() call times out, the call back function is called. The registration
can either be so that the call back <EM>always</EM> is called when that the
select call times out <EM>or</EM> only when Library sockets are in use.
<PRE>
typedef int HTEventTimeout (HTRequest *);

extern BOOL HTEvent_registerTimeout (struct timeval *tp, HTRequest * request, HTEventTimeout *tcbf, BOOL always);
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="req"></A>
<H2>
  Issue Requests to the Library
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">Access module</A> has a set of functions
that works as a user interface to the <A HREF="../src/HTReqMan.html">request
manager</A>. You can call the request manager directly but often it is simpler
to use the <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">Access module</A>. As mentioned,
the request manager returns immediately and the result of the request is
handled back to the application using the termination handlers.
<P>
<H3>
  What and When to Escape Strings
</H3>
<P>
The Library's represents internally location strings as URLs which means
that they <EM>always</EM> are escaped. Only when it is required to access
a resource are they unescaped, for example via FTP. All location strings
passed to the Library are also treated as URLs which means that they
<EM>must</EM> be escaped already. Hence in the case of the request methods
mentioned aboce, all URL arguments <EM>must</EM> be escaped if the resource
is to be found.
<P>
Most often this is only a problem when people type in location strings directly,
for example using "goto location" etc. In the
<A HREF="../src/HTEscape.html">Escape module</A> the Library provides two
functions for escaping location strings into URLs and unescaping URLs into
location strings:
<PRE>
typedef enum _HTURIEncoding {
    URL_XALPHAS         = 0x1,
    URL_XPALPHAS        = 0x2,
    URL_PATH            = 0x4
} HTURIEncoding;

extern char * HTEscape (const char * str, HTURIEncoding mask);
extern char * HTUnEscape (char * str);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Multiple Simultaneous Requests
</H3>
<P>
Multiple simultaneous requests can be started at any time from within an
event handler. It is simply a question of calling one of the load functions
in the <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">Access module</A>. The Library keeps
a request queue where all active requests are kept. The application can define
the maximum number of open sockets that can be open at any one time. This
number is by default 6 but can be changed using the following functions:
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNet_setMaxSocket (int newmax);
extern int  HTNet_maxSocket (void);
</PRE>
<P>
If there are no free sockets available the request is put into a pending
queue and started as soon as possible. <A NAME="cxt"></A>
<H2>
  Putting a request into a Context
</H2>
<P>
When multiple requests can be initiated simultaneously it is in general not
possible to predict the order that the results return to the application.
This is a function of the size of the individual data objects, net work speed
etc. In order to keep track of ordering of the requests, for example in the
history list, it is necessary to put them into some kind of context. The
Library provides the hooks for maintaining a context together with the
<A HREF="../src/HTReqMan.html">Request object</A> by the following methods:
<PRE>
typedef int HTRequestCallback (HTRequest * request, void *param);

extern void HTRequest_setCallback (HTRequest *request, HTRequestCallback *cb);
extern HTRequestCallback *HTRequest_callback (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>
<P>
The callback function can be passed an arbitrary pointer (the void part)
which can describe the context of the current request structure. If such
context information is desired then it can be set using the following methods:
<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setContext (HTRequest *request, void *context);
extern void *HTRequest_context (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>
<P>
There is no limit to the definition of a context data object and the memory
management if entirely up to the application. The Request object simply carries
the information around.
<H2>
  Interrupt a request
</H2>
<P>
Any request can be interrupted from an event handler by calling either of
the functions (the first kills a specific request, the second is more radical
and kills them all):
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_kill	(HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTNet_killAll	(void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Logging and History Management
</H2>
<P>
The library has a set of modules that are not called from within the library
at all but can be used by the application. Two examples are a
<A HREF="../src/HTHist.html">History manager</A> and a
<A HREF="../src/HTLog.html">Log manager</A> that provides functionality for
keeping a history list of visited objects and to provide logging of the results.
The application is free to use there modules but does not have to.
<A NAME="user"></A>
<H2>
  User Messages
</H2>
<P>
The library has a basic <A HREF="../src/HTAlert.html">User Messages and
Prompts</A> module which is intended for the Line Mode Browser. In case you
are building a GUI client you would probably want to write your own version
using windows etc. This can be done by overriding the module in the Library
with your own that has the same set of functions as described in the
<A HREF="./">User's Guide</A>. <A NAME="free"></A>
<H2>
  When to free Objects
</H2>
<P>
This is a short set of recommendation on when to free objects in memory.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../src/HTAnchor.html">Anchors</A>
  <DD>
    Anchors are normally not freed before the application terminates as they
    have important information about the part of the Web that the user has been
    in tough with. However, anchors <EM>can</EM> be freed at any time if they
    are not used by an ongoing request
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../src/HTReq.html">Requests</A>
  <DD>
    Request objects are only intended to live as long as a request is being executed.
    A request object is a "information binder" that binds various data objects
    together as long as the request is running. As the Library uses asynchronous
    network I/O many requests can be handled "in parallel" but each request object
    only knows about one request. Therefore a request object can be free whenever
    a it has terminated which is the case when the request termination handler
    is called.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../src/HTStream.html">Streams</A>
  <DD>
    Streams are used as the main media for data transportation in the Library.
    Therefore they are normally hooked together in what is called stream chains
    where data can carry the data from the user to the network and vice verse.
    As any operation on a stream ripples through the whole chain of streams you
    should not free any streams on your own. The free method is initiated in
    the Library, for example when all data has been transferred from a remote
    server and the connection closed.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../src/HTCache.html">Memory Cache Objects</A>
  <DD>
    As mentioned in the section on memory cache handlers the application can
    handle all data objects in memory as it likes. Therefore the app is also
    free to delete any object at any time but of course this is a balance between
    memory and performance - it takes a <EM>lot</EM> longer to get a data object
    from a remote server than to keep it in memory!

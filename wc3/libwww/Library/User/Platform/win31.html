<H1>Compilation on Windows</H1>

I have been working with the W3lib on the 16/32-bit Windows platform
for a couple of months now and would like to share some of the
important considerations I discovered along the way. Hope this would
prevent others from running into the same wall(s) and encourage more
sharing of the W3Lib's Windows port. <P>

These notes are by no means complete, just some which I've deemed 
important enough to be written down every now and then.


<H2>Compiling W3Lib into 16-bit DLLs</H2>

<OL>

<LI>Make sure the Windows prolog/epilog code is generated for
functions where global variables of the DLL are referenced.

<LI>Can't share a file pointer between different DLLs as the C
Run-Time routines are linked individually into the DLLs. I'm not
sure if there's a DLL version of the C Run-Time library (available in VC++ 
2.x) which can resolve this problem.


<LI>I recommend compiling using a Huge model and replacing malloc()
with the GlobalAllocPtr macro.

<LI>You will probably face the problem of "too many segments" if you 
try to build the whole library into a single DLL.
</OL>

<H2>Compiling W3Lib into 32-bit DLLs</H2>

<OL>
<LI>I/O file handles cannot be shared between different DLLs unless 
they are linked with the DLL version of the C Run-Time Library.
 
<PRE>
    i.e.    if function A of DLL X do an "fopen", it cannot call 
            function B of DLL Y to do subsequent "fread".
</PRE> 
</OL>

<H2>Modifications made to the original W3Lib source code</H2>

<UL>

<LI>In "tcp.h", watch out for the following lines if you're not
developing on the NT platform.

<PRE>
#undef NETREAD
#undef NETWRITE

#define NETREAD(s,b,l)  ((s) >= 10) ? recv((s),(b),(l),0) : read ((s),(b), (l))
#define NETWRITE(s,b,l) ((s) >= 10) ? send((s),(b),(l),0) : write((s),(b), (l))
</PRE>

This is a major cause of system crash. Other symtoms I've experienced
include: messed-up desktop display, warp mouse pointers.

This conditional clause needs to be removed for proper socket use
under Windows 3.x and Windows 95.

<LI>"sscanf" does not work in 16-bit DLLs. Replacement code has to be
supplied. I recomment using "atoi" & "atof" where possible.

</UL>

<H1>Notes About Solaris</H1>

<HR>

These are the installation and user notes for the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Status.html">CERN HTTP Server</A>, the <A
HREF="../../Status.html">Library of Common Code</A> and the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Status.html">Line Mode Browser</A>. Any
comments and suggestions are welcome at
<EM>libwww@w3.org</EM>. <P>

The following hints are from Simon E Spero,
<EM>&lt;ses@tipper.oit.unc.edu&gt;</EM>

<UL>

<LI> Solaris has problems accepting lots of simultaneous connections.
You can alleviate the problem somewhat by increasing the size of the
maximum connection queue by using the following command:

<PRE>
	# ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_conn_req_max 32
</PRE>

<LI> Another problem that Solaris has is with the period of time it
leaves closed connections in the TIME_WAIT state; Solaris uses the
reccommended value of 4 minutes; this can result in thousands of tcbs
hanging around tieing up memory.  Unless you're regularly serving
files to sites out beyond lunar orbit, dropping this value to about 30
seconds (as it was in 4.1.3) should be safe.  If you do have people
sending HTTP requests from that area, then somebody at NASA has way
too much spare time on their hands. To change this paramter to a more
sensible setting, use the following command.

<PRE>
	# ndd -set /dev/tcp tcp_close_wait_interval 30000
</PRE>

This will also help ftp, gopher and any other one-shot protocols.

</UL>

<H3>Mac and PC socket problem</H3>
When a Mac or a PC opens a connection with the http daemon, then dies, 
the connection hangs up. If your http daemon is running stand-alone, 
you can stop the loop:
<UL>
<LI> edit the file /usr/local/bin/httpd_clean:<PRE>
#! /bin/csh
#
# author: Arthur Secret (webmaster@w3.org)
#
set boum4 = `ps -ef | grep 'httpd ' | grep nobody | awk '{print $2}'`
echo '#! /bin/csh' > /tmp/httpd_clean.tmp
echo "kill $boum4" >> /tmp/httpd_clean.tmp
echo ' ' >> /tmp/httpd_clean.tmp
chmod +x /tmp/httpd_clean.tmp
sleep 190
/tmp/httpd_clean.tmp
rm /tmp/httpd_clean.tmp

</PRE>
<LI> Let's say your http daemon runs as nobody. As we need to create a crontab
file for nobody, you must edit the file /etc/cron.d/cron.allow and add the line<PRE>
nobody
</PRE>
<LI> Then, as root, type<PRE>
crontab -e nobody
</PRE>
and insert the line<PRE>
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /usr/local/bin/httpd_clean > /dev/null 2>&1
</PRE>
</UL>
By modifying the first line of /usr/local/bin/httpd_clean, you may use
this to clean other daemons as well.

<H1>Notes About Windows NT</H1>

These are the installation and user notes for the <A
HREF="../../">W3C Reference Library</A> and the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>. Any
comments and suggestions are welcome at
<EM>libwww@w3.org</EM>. <P>

The NT port is now much better and we can thank <A
HREF="mailto:cbrooks@osf.org">Charlie Brooks</A> for this. He has made
a <A HREF="../../../../Dist/libwww/README-WinNT">README-WinNT</A>
describing how to get started. <A
HREF="mailto:samaa@ceci.mit.edu">Wissam Y Ali-Ahmed</A> has also made
important contributions. See also the notes on <A
HREF="Windows.html">Windows</A>

<DT><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/winsocks.htm">WinSock DLL</A>

<DD>The socket interface is based on a <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/winsocks.htm">WinSock
DLL</A>, preferably a version greater than 1.1.

<DT>Dynamic Library (DLL)

<DD>The Library can't compile as a DLL out of the box. It requires
some modifications and possibly some minor patches. Please remember to
send the patches, so that we can put them in!

<DT>Direct <A HREF="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html">WAIS</A> access

<DD>The normal possibility for linking with the WAIS library is not
possible on the Windows NT platform. Therefore the WWW Library module
<A HREF="../../Implementation/HTWAIS.c">HTWAIS</A> must be excluded in
the make file.

<DT>Memory Model

<DD>The memory model used should be <EM>LARGE</EM>. This has the
limitation that a single data object can't exceed 64K which might
cause problems in some situations.

<DT>Errno Constants

<DD>WinSock doesn't define the errno constants EWOULDBLOCK etc. on a
NT platform in order to avoid clashes with the internal errno
constants. We have provided some of the constants in <A
HREF="../../Implementation/tcp.html">tcp module</A>

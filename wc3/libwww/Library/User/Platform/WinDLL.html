<h1>Building libwww for Windows 95/98/NT</h1>
<p>
When building libwww on Windows 95/98/NT, you can decide on a set of different
options to be enabled or disabled:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="#select">Interleaved vs Asynchronous Sockets</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#io">Console vs GUI Application</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#lib">Static vs Dynamic Libraries</a>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="select">Interleaved vs Asynchronous Sockets</a></h2>
<p>
Non-blocking network access can either be done using multiplexed I/O or
asynchronous I/O. Multiplexed I/O is based on an event loop with a
<code>select()</code> system call. The <code>select()</code> system call is a
function that scans a set of BSD like socket descriptors and returns when one
or more sockets are ready for either network <b>read</b> or <b>write</b>.
Asynchronous I/O is based on signals instead of a <code>select()</code> call.
Each time a socket is ready for a network operation, for example <b>read</b>,
a signal is generated. This signal can then be caught by the application in an
signal handler. Using the <code>select()</code> call is called
<em>reactive</em> whereas using signals is called <em>pro-active</em>.</p>
<p>
Libwww can handle both approaches under Windows, and therefore you must choose
which model you prefer. The choice can depend on what type of application you
are using and what other libraries you are using. </p>

<h3><a name="unix">Interleaved I/O Using select()</a></h3>
<p>
In this mode the <a href="../../src/HTEvtLst.html">Event Manager</a> registers
all active sockets and passes them to a <code>select()</code> call which then
processes the registered sockets. When <code>select()</code> returns the Event
Manager dispatches the appropriate handlers as the sockets get ready.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b>
<em>Undefine</em> <b>WWW_WIN_ASYNC</b> as a preprocessor directive when
generating the project for the Library. Please make sure that <em>all</em>
DLLs are compiled without this flag. </p>

<h3><a name="async">Asynchronous I/O based using Signals
(<em>DEFAULT</em>)</a></h3>
<p>
Here the <a href="../../src/HTEvtLst.html">Event Manager</a> registers all
active sockets using <code>WSAAsyncSelect</code> which is part of the WinSock
API. When <code>AsyncSelect()</code> which is the asynchronous equivalent to
the <code>select()</code> returns, the Event Manager dispatches the results of
the <code>AsyncSelect()</code>. As the asynchronous select call needs a
windows handle, the Library creates a <em>hidden window</em>. This window is
<em>not</em> to be used explicitly by the application and the Library closes
the window when exiting.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b>
<em>Define</em> <b>WWW_WIN_ASYNC</b> as preprocessor directives when
generating the project for the Library.</p>

<h2><a name="io">Console vs GUI Application</a></h2>
<p>
A Windows application can use either a character based command line interface,
or a graphic windows interface. Many MS-DOS applications do run as a simple
command line tool which doesn't use GUI at all. Under Win32, there is a notion
of a <a href="#console">console</a> application. This means that all user
interaction happens through a standard DOS shell interface, with a FILE
pointer like that in Unix. This does not exist under Win16, where a Windows
window is required.</p>
<p>
Libwww supports both the console and the windows interface, and again you must
choose what version you prefer. This is often something you have to decide as
you are creating the project. </p>

<h3><a name="windowed">Windows Application (<em>DEFAULT</em>)</a></h3>
<p>
If you want to make a windows application then this is the mode to use. Eric
Prud'hommeaux has provided a Windows application wrapper for the <a
href="../../../LineMode/">W3C Line Mode Browser</a> which you can use in order
to build the browser as a Windows application. This is found in <a
href="../../../LineMode/src/windows/www.c">www.c</a>. Three other modules, <a
href="../../../LineMode/src/windows/scroll.c">scroll.c</a> and <a
href="../../../LineMode/src/windows/lib.c">lib.c</a> provide the window for
the application.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b> Define
<b>_WINDOWS</b> as preprocessor directives when generating the project for the
Library.</p>

<h3><a name="console">Console Application</a></h3>
<p>
The console option is available only in Win32 in which case all user
interaction happens through the Win32 console window. This model strongly
resembles a Unix vt100 terminal interface.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b> Define
<b>_CONSOLE</b> as preprocessor directives when generating the project for the
Library.</p>

<h2><a name="lib">Static vs Dynamic Libraries</a></h2>
<p>
Windows has a concept of both static and dynamic libraries, the latter also
known as <em>DLLs</em>. It is out of scope here to describe the difference
between DLLs and static libraries, but as DLLs is based on a lot more flexible
memory model it is almost always the best solution for Windows
applications.</p>
<p>
The W3C Sample Code Library support both models in that if can be built as
either one big static library or as a set of small DLLs. As mentioned, it is
in almost all cases recommended to build DLLs instead of static libraries, and
on Win16 it is required because a static library is too big.</p>

<h3><a name="static">Static Library</a></h3>
<p>
The libraries may be build as one large static library. This is how libwww is
implemented on Unix platforms. Subsequent references to the various DLLs may
all be assumed to refer to the staticly linked libwww. Care has been taken to
insure that there are no <code>#define</code> conflicts where one library
would want a <code>#define</code> that would interfere with the modules in
other libraries. When building a static library, see the following sections on
<a href="#select">Select Options</a> and <a href="#io">Input/Output
Options</a>, accumulate all the <code>#defines</code> that are required, and
build the whole of libwww with those <code>#defines</code>.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b>
<em>Undefine</em> <b>WWW_WIN_DLL</b> as preprocessor directives when
generating the project for the Library. Please note, that it is not
recommended to staticly link to the libraries if you are building a Win16
application as it creates segment size problems. </p>

<h3><a name="dynamic">Dynamic Libraries (<em>DEFAULT</em>)</a></h3>
<p>
The libwww can also be built as a set of DLLs that follows the modular
architecture of the Library. This enables the application programmer to choose
exactly what functionality should be enabled in the application. The
boundaries between these DLLs are based on module interdependency and some
assumptions regarding which modules may be replaced by the application. Unlike
static linking, dynamic linking requires that all the modules in a DLL be
replaced at once. This is because the DLL needs all internal references to be
resolved at build time.</p>
<p>

<b>WWW_WIN_DLL</b> as preprocessor directives when generating the project for
the Library.</p>

<h3>Special Windows DLL</h3>
<p>
In addition to platform independent modules, there is a small Windows specific
DLL which implements the trace message generation. The DLL is called
<code>windll.dll</code> and contains also the definition of the global trace
flag definition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>windll.c</code> - <code>DLLMain</code> to <code>all</code> DLLs.
</li>
<li>
<code>wwwdll.c</code> - instances <code>WWW_TraceFlag</code>. This is included
in wwwdll so that it can export the variables to the rest of the DLLs.
</li>
<li>
<code>wwwdll.def</code>, <code>wwwutils.def</code>, <code>wwwcore.def</code> -
def (exports) files for the DLLs of the same names.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b> Include
the windll.dll as a part of your project and make sure that it is built as the
first DLL.</p>

<h3>Exporting Functions from DLLs</h3>
<p>
The functions exported from a DLL are listed in the <code>EXPORTS</code>
section of a <code>.def</code> file. These can be found in the <a
href="../../src/windows">windows</a> directory. These may also be build by the
<a href="../../../config/makedefs.pl">makeDefs.pl</a> perl script, see the
description below. You can use the def files as a basis for generating the DLL
projects for your compiler.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet"> <b>What to do:</b> Generate
the DLLs according to the def files so the exported interface is identical to
the set of functions defined in the actual c files included in the DLL.</p>

<h2><a name="Make">Make Files and Projects</a></h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, make files are not easily shared among different C compilers on
Windows which complicates the distribution. See the <a
href="../../../INSTALL.html#Windows">installation instructions</a> for details
on possible ways of building libwww on windows.</p>

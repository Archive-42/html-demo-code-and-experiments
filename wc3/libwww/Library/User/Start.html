  Libwww Quick Guide
</H1>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/WWWCore.html">libwww core</A> is the central part of
<A HREF="../">libwww</A>. By itself it doesn't do much - it is not capable
of accessing any local files, HTTP servers, &nbsp;or any other Internet service.
Also, it does not know about authentication, redirection, caching or any
other often used feature. The reason for this is&nbsp;that not all applications
need the same amount of functionality and also they do not need it to be
done in the same order. Therefore, in order to accommodate the various needs
of different types of applications, libwww has a set of application profiles
which initialize the libwww core with a standard set of features provided
as a part of the libwww distribution-file.
<H2>
  Installation
</H2>
<P>
If you have not already installed and compiled libwww then have a look at
our <A HREF="../../INSTALL.html">installation guide</A> before you continue.
<H2>
  Application Profiles
</H2>
<P>
Libwww comes with a large set of default functions, for example for accessing
HTTP and FTP servers, parsing
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC
822</A> headers etc. but it must all be registered by the application before
the core knows about it. You can either register the parts directly through
the many initialization functions in the Initialization Interface or you
can use these "precompiled" profiles which are set up to contain the features
often used by the a specific type of application, for example a client and
a robot.
<H3>
  Client Profile
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/HTProfil.html#Client">Client profile</A> initializes
a large set of features often used in client applications. These include
features like:
<UL>
  <LI>
    HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, Telnet Access , local file access and optionally
    WAIS access
  <LI>
    MIME parser
  <LI>
    Access authentication and Automatic redirection
  <LI>
    Rule file management, proxy server and gateway support
  <LI>
    Chunked Encoders and decoders
  <LI>
    Request Log Manager
  <LI>
    History Manager
</UL>
<H3>
  Robot Profile
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/HTProfil.html#Robot">Robot profile</A> initializes a
large set of features often used in robot applications. These include features
like:
<UL>
  <LI>
    HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, Telnet Access , local file access and optionally
    WAIS access
  <LI>
    MIME parser
  <LI>
    Access authentication and Automatic redirection
  <LI>
    Rule file management, proxy server and gateway support
  <LI>
    Chunked Encoders and decoders
  <LI>
    Request Log Manager
</UL>
<H2>
  Issuing a Request
</H2>
<P>
When you want to load a URL, or perform some other method, for example sending
a document to a remote server, you must create a Request object -fill it
out with your preferences, and pass it to libwww. In the application interface,
there is already a large set of functions that help you set up the request
in order to perform the operation you want. For example, there are functions
that download a document into a memory buffer, save a document to local file,
or to POST form data to&nbsp;a remote HTTP server.
<P>
When a request is passed to libwww, libwww calls a set of filters that can
modify the request in&nbsp;various ways before it is passed on to the network
layers of libwww. Also, after a request has terminated, libwww calls a set
of AFTER filters that interpret the result and can perform variousoperations
based on this result. If the request succeeds and we start receiving data
from the other end of the connection, libwww creates a stream pipe which
feeds data from the network layers back to the&nbsp;application. In the request
object you can specify the final destination for your data, for example
presenting it to a user, save it to a file, or to send it over the network.
<H2>
  Filters
</H2>
<P>
Libwww has a concept of filters that can be called when a request object
has been passed to libwww and when the request has terminated.These filters
handle a lot of the functionality enabled by the application profiles. For
&nbsp;example, access authentication, redirection, logging,cache validation,
proxy support and much more are implemented as filters.Filters can be registered
either locally to a single request of globally for all requests. Global filters
is useful if the filter is to be performed very often and local filters can
either add to or override the global set of filters.
<P>
All filters are registered at run-time, and filters can be cascaded so that
one filter can call other filters and so on. Filters can also start new requests
or terminate existing requests, so the set of possibilities is very big.
Normally, filters do only handle metainformation about a resource.For example,
the authentication filters looks to see if we have been asked to provide
some&nbsp;credentials in order to access a URL. If so then it adds a protocol
defined header to the&nbsp;request, and if not&nbsp;then the request just
proceeds.
<H2>
  Streams
</H2>
<P>
One thing filters can not do is to add a document to the request- for example
if you are using a <TT>PUT</TT> method in order to send a document &nbsp;to
a remote HTTP server. Instead, libwww uses streams to transport data objects
from the application over the network, or&nbsp;the other way. Streams are
advantageous as they handle data as&nbsp;soon as it arrives and they can
be cascaded into stream pipes. Each stream element in a stream pipe can do
some operation on the data object. Streams can be used for many things: they
can convert data object from one data type to another, or they can apply
a compression algorithm or a transport encoding, for example base 64.
However,streams can also be used for calculating the content length, or to
generate an MD5 hash of the data object.
<P>
Stream pipes are generated by looking at the <I>content-type</I>, the<I>
content-encoding</I>, and the <I>transport-encoding</I> of a data object.That
is, if libwww receives a document encoded using chunked transfer-encoding,
then it looks to see if it has a stream object which can decode this encoding
and pass it to the next stream in the stream pipe.
<P>
Another feature of streams is that they can be forked into multiple streams
and then do different operations on each branch of the stream. This is for
example how we cache a document while we are presenting it to the user, or
you can also preserve the original HTML text in one branch while parsing
the document in another.
<H2>
  Request a URL
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="../src/WWWApp.html">application interface</A> provides many
helper functions that make libwww core easier to use. This is particular
the case for accessing URLs where you can find a large set of functions in
the <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A>. If these functions
for some reason are not what you are looking for then you can of course go
ahead and write your own additions but you should find what is needed at
least to get started!
<H2>
  Should I use the Internal SGML/HTML Parser?
</H2>
<P>
Libwww contains code for parsing an HTML document but not to present it to
the user. The reason for that is that libwww is platform independent and
doesn't know about the UI interface at all. The libwww HTML parser is quite
crude as it has not been updated for a long time. Instead we refer you to
the <A HREF="../../Amaya/">Amaya browser/edirtor</A> for a full HTML parser.
However, <I>if</I> you prefer using the default libwww HTML parser (like
for example the Line Mode Browser) then you <I>must</I> provide a set of
functions that meet the <A HREF="../src/HText.html">HText Interface
definition</A>.
<P>
The HTML parser calls the HText interface each time it has identified an
HTML element, but doesn't put any restrictions on what the HText function
actually do with the data. Two different examples are the Line Mode Browser
which renders the information and presents it to the user; and the Mini Robot
which uses the anchor information to start new requests in order to traverse
the Web space. The illustration below shows how the libwww HTML parser is
organized with a description of the model below.
<P>

<DL>
  <DT>
    <I>Stream Interface</I>
  <DD>
    Use this interface if you do <I>not</I> want to use any of the SGML/HTML
    parsers in libwww. The default mode is <I>not</I> to initialize the libwww
    SGML/HTML parser. You will have to set if up explicitly, for example by calling
    <A HREF="../src/HTHInit.html">HTMLInit</A>.
  <DT>
    <I>Structured Stream Interface</I>
  <DD>
    Use this interface if you do want the libwww SGML parser but <I>not</I> the
    HTML parser. The SGML parser is a generic (but crude) SGML parser which can
    be setup with a specific DTD. It should of course only be a SGML lexer but
    this is not the case. It normally feeds the HTML parser with structured data.
    In this case, you will be emulating the <A HREF="../src/HTML.html">HTML
    module</A>, and generating a hypertext object from the structured stream.
  <DT>
    <I>HText Call Back Interface</I>
  <DD>
    This requires the full SGML/HTML parser in libwww. After the data object
    has been parsed by the SGML and the HTML parser, the HTML parser calls the
    HText interface so that the application can render it. The callback functions
    are all declared but not defined in the <A HREF="../src/HText.html">HText
    module</A>. The client must provide the actual code that defines the presentation
    method used for a specific HTML tag. You can set up this mode by calling
    <A HREF="../src/HTHInit.html">HTMLInit</A>.

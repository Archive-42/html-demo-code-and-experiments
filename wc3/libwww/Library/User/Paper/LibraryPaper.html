  Abstract
</H2>
<P>
This paper describes the current status of the <A HREF="../../">World-Wide
Web Library of Common Code</A> and the work done in order to start the
convergence process towards a uniform Library. Currently many World-Wide
Web applications are using different versions of the Library with a set of
added functionality that is often either incompatible with the other versions
or represents an overlap of code development. A new initiative has been taken
at <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</A> in the context of the
<A HREF="/">W3C</A> collaboration with
<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</A> in order to converge the current versions
of the Library so that existing and future World-Wide Web applications have
a powerful and uniform interface to the Internet.
<H2>
  1. Introduction
</H2>
<P>
The CERN World-Wide Web Library of Common Code is a general code base that
can be used as the basis for building World-Wide Web clients and servers.
It allows software suppliers and researchers to achieve the state of the
art technology and derive their own resources to pushing forward that technology.
As an example, the CERN Line Mode Browser, the NeXTStep Editor and the HTTP
Server (including the CERN Proxy Server) are all built on top of the Library.
It contains code for accessing <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A>,
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/0/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc765.txt">FTP</A>,
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/0/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1436.txt">Gopher</A>,
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/0/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc977.txt">NNTP</A>,
and WAIS servers, perform telnet sessions and access the local file system.
Furthermore it provides functionality for loading, parsing and caching graphic
objects plus a wide spectrum of generic programming utilities. The development
of the World-Wide Web Library of Common Code was started by
<A HREF="../../../People.html#BernersLee">Tim Berners-Lee</A> in 1990. Ever
since the code has been subject to changes due to modifications in the
architectural model, additions of new features etc. This paper describes
the current architecture in the Library and some of the ongoing projects
of implementing new features and changing the architecture. The Library is
available from the <A HREF="../../Status.html">Status of the Library of Common
Code Page</A>. <A NAME="ConcernSec"></A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="ConcernSec">2. Implementation and Portability Concerns</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Library is written in plain C and is especially designed to be used on
a large set of different platforms. Currently it supports more than 15 Unix
flavors and VMS. A year ago it also supported the MS-DOS, Macintosh, VM/CMS,
and other platforms but this was with a limited set of the current functionality.
Recently a new initiative has been taken at CERN as a result of the "First
International Conference on the World-Wide Web" held in Geneva, Switzerland,
May 1994. It involves the development teams from Lynx, Spyglass, NCSA, OmniWeb
and others with special interest in the development of a uniform Library.
The goal is to converge current versions of the Library into a single version
which can support a broad spectrum of applications. Current topics of discussion
and development involve:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Re-porting the Library to MS-DOS and Macintosh
  <LI>
    Enhancing the current architecture of the Library - especially on defining
    a client API
  <LI>
    Adding new features such as security, enhanced error handling, multiple threads,
    format converters, protocol modules.
  <LI>
    Whether to use ANSI C and Posix standards and the possible portability problems
    this might involve
</UL>
<P>
Especially the last topic is a practical problem as many platforms do not
fully support the standards as defined, but only implements a subset of these.
It is therefore a compromise between choosing the largest possible subset
of the set of standardized functions with a minimal loss in portability.
Unfortunately there is no simple answer to this problem.
<A NAME="LibraryArchitecture"></A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="LibraryArchitecture">3. Library Architecture</A>
</H2>
<P>
The general architecture of the Library as viewed from a client is illustrated
in <A HREF="#Library">Figure 1</A>. Servers and proxy servers have a slightly
different view of the Library, but the client view is the most descriptive.
<P>
<A NAME="Library"><IMG ALT="[Library]" SRC="Library"></A>
<P>
The flow of the Library shows that all network communication and parsing
of data objects is handled internally. The client then has to present the
information to the user. The main elements in the figure are explained below.
A more detailed description of the implementation of the Library is given
in <A HREF="../Guide/"> Library Internals and Programmer's Guide</A>.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Graphic Object</B>
  <DD>
    A graphic object is a displayable entity handled and maintained by the client.
    It is built from the data contained in a server response upon a successful
    request initiated by the user. The data can be of any format handled by the
    client. The object can either be built directly from the data, e.g., if the
    data object returned is an <A HREF="../../../MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML</A>
    document, or it can be generated from a format converter within the Library.
    An example of the latter could be the generation of an HTML object from an
    FTP directory listing (7-bit ASCII). Graphic objects are in general coded
    differently on different GUI platforms. The graphic object is responsible
    for displaying itself, catching mouse clicks, and calling the Anchor Manager,
    either directly or via the History and Navigation Manager. Often the more
    common term "document" is used to describe the logical entity which a graphics
    object represents and displays. The client can keep the latest generated
    documents in memory in order to speed up back-tracking through already visited
    documents.
  <DT>
    <B>Stream Manager</B>
  <DD>
    The Stream Manager takes care of the transportation of streams of data from
    the Internet to the client and vice versa. This module is described in more
    detail in <A HREF="#StreamConcept">Section 4</A>.
    <P>
  <DT>
    <B>Anchor Manager</B>
  <DD>
    When a request is passed from the client to the Library it always has an
    anchor associated with it. An anchor is an object representing the URI of
    either a graphic or a fragment of a graphic object. It contains all information
    known about the URI. The Anchor Manager registers all requested anchors together
    with anchors found when parsing hypertext objects. The anchors are stored
    in a hash table so that multiple references to a URI all points to the same
    graphic object. It furthermore binds all registered anchors together
    corresponding to the logical binding between the related data objects. In
    other words, this module generates an internal model of the part of the Web
    the user has been in touch with. The actual bindings between anchors are
    described in more detail in <A HREF="#AnchorsSec">Section 5</A>.
    <P>
  <DT>
    <B>Navigation and History</B>
  <DD>
    This module keeps track of all visited anchors. The set of visited anchors
    is always less than or equal to the total set of anchors registered in the
    Anchor Manager. Whereas the Anchor Manager manages a small part of the Web,
    this module keeps an ordered list of all visited anchors so the user can
    do quick navigation through a history list.
    <P>
  <DT>
    <B>Client Cache Manager</B>
  <DD>
    This is a single-user disk cache module specifically for WWW Clients. It
    is used to save data objects once they have been downloaded from the Internet.
    The difference between a graphic object stored in memory and a cached data
    object is that the former is already parsed and can immediately be displayed
    to the user whereas the cached object must be parsed into a graphic object.
    The CERN proxy server has its own cache manager to handle a large scale cache
    that can serve hundreds of clients connected to it. The client cache is
    especially made for clients not using a proxy cache or having a very slow
    link but a large local temporary storage.
    <P>
  <DT>
    <B>Protocol Manager</B>
  <DD>
    The Protocol Manager is invoked by the Anchor Manager in order to access
    a document not found in memory or in the cache (for the proxy server it is
    the proxy cache). Each protocol module is responsible for establishing the
    connection to the remote server (or the local file-system) and extract
    information using a specific access method. Depending on the protocol, the
    Protocol Module either builds a hypertext object itself from the server response,
    or it passes a socket descriptor to the Stream Manager for parsing by one
    of the parser modules.
    <P>
  <DT>
    <B>Error Manager</B>
  <DD>
    This module manages an information stack which contains information of all
    errors occurred during the communication with a remote server or simply
    information about the current state. Using a stack for this kind of information
    provides the possibility of nested error messages like:
    <PRE>
	Error 500
	Can't access document (ftp://ftp.w3.org/foo.bar)
	Reason: FTP-server replies: foo.bar: No such file or directory
</PRE>
  <DT>
    <B>Directory Listing Manager</B>
  <DD>
    This module handles long directory listings with icons for HTTP and FTP,
    and local file access. Long directory listings are supported for Unix, VMS,
    and Window NT.
</DL>
<H3>
  3.1 Modularity of the Library
</H3>
<P>
The Stream Manager and the Protocol Manager are both designed in a highly
modular style in that they use pointers to functions when they decide on
what protocol or parser to use respectively. For the Protocol Manager, the
actual binding between an access scheme specified in the
<A HREF="../../../Addressing/Addressing.html">URL</A> and the protocol module
used is done in a separate protocol structure which can be setup at run-time.
Likewise for the Stream Manager where the binding is based on
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/0/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">
MIME-types</A>, either found directly in the response code from the remote
server or by guessing. This model makes it very easy to install new stream
converters and protocol modules.
<H2>
  <A NAME="StreamConcept">4. The Stream Concept</A>
</H2>
<P>
Streams are the main method used in the Library for transporting data from
the network to the client or vice versa, and they do therefore deserve a
more thorough presentation.
<H3>
  4.1 What is a Stream
</H3>
<P>
A stream is an object which accepts sequences of characters. It is a destination
of data which can be thought of much like an output stream in C++ or an ANSI
C-file stream for writing data to a disk or another pheripheral device. The
Library defines a generic stream class with five methods as illustrated in
<A HREF="#Stream">Figure 2</A>. The output is also a stream and is often
referred to as the "target" or "sink". This class is a superclass of all
other stream classes in the Library and it provides a uniform interface to
all stream objects regardless of what stream sub-class they originate from.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="Stream"><IMG ALT="[Stream]" SRC="Stream"></A>
<P>
Streams can be cascaded so that one stream writes into another using one
or more of the methods shown in <A HREF="#Stream">Figure 2</A>. This means
that a required processing of data, for example reading data from the Internet
can be done as the total effect of several cascaded streams. The Library
currently includes a large set of specific stream modules for writing to
an ANSI file structure, writing to a socket, stripping Carriage Returns,
splitting a stream into two (used for caching) etc. The stream-based architecture
allows the Library (and hence applications built on top of it) to be event-driven
in the sense that when input arrives, it is put into a stream, and any necessary
actions then cascade off this event. An event can either be data arriving
from the Internet, or data arriving from the client application. The latter
would be the case when the client is posting a data object to a remote server.
<H3>
  4.2 Structured Streams
</H3>
<P>
A structured stream is a subclass of a stream, but instead of just accepting
data, it also accepts the SGML "begin element", "end element", and "put entity"
as illustrated in <A HREF="#StrucStream">Figure 3</A>
<P>
<A NAME="StrucStream"><IMG ALT="[StrucStream]" SRC="StrucStream"></A>
<P>
A structured stream therefore represents a structured document and can be
thought of as the output from an SGML parser. It is more efficient for modules
which generate hypertext objects to output a structured stream than to output
SGML which is then parsed. The elements and entities in the stream are referred
to by numbers, rather than strings. A DTD contains the mapping between element
names and numbers, so each instance of a structured stream is associated
with a corresponding DTD. The only DTD which is currently in the Library
is an extended version of the HTML DTD level 1, but current work is done
to update this to comply with the emerging HTML level 3 specification.
<H3>
  4.3 Format Conversion Using the Stream Stack
</H3>
<P>
The stream stack is used to select the most appropriate converter from the
input format given by the protocol modules and the desired output format
specified by the client. A converter is simply a stream which is registered
as a converter from a given input MIME-type to a output MIME-type. If more
than one converter is capable of doing the same conversion a quality factor
is used to (subjectively) distinguish which one is the best. Currently the
stream stack module only manages a single converter at the time, for example
from text/plain to text/html, that is, the size of the stack is always 1.
However, work is being done to expand the stack so that several converters
can be cascaded in order to obtain the desired conversion.
<A NAME="AnchorsSec"></A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="AnchorsSec">5. Anchors</A>
</H2>
<P>
Anchors represent any references to graphic objects which may be the sources
or destinations of hypertext links. There are basically two types of anchors:
parent anchors which represent whole graphic objects and child anchors which
represent parts of a graphic object. As mentioned in
<A HREF="#LibraryArchitecture">Section 3</A>, every request and hence every
graphic object has a parent anchor associated with it. Anchors exist throughout
the lifetime of the client, but as this generally is not the case for graphic
objects, it is possible to have a parent anchor without a graphic object.
If the data object is stored in the client cache, the parent anchor contains
a link to it so that the client can access it through the Cache Manager.
Both types of anchors are subclasses of a generic anchor class which defines
a set of outgoing links to where the anchor points. The relationship between
parent anchors and child anchors is illustrated in <A HREF="#Anchors">Figure
4</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="Anchors"><IMG ALT="[Anchors]" SRC="Anchors"></A>
<P>
Every parent anchor points to a remote data object. In the case of posting
an anchor to a remote server, the data object is yet to be created. The client
can assign a URI for the object but it might be overwritten (or completely
denied) by the server. In <A HREF="#Anchors">Figure 4</A>, parent <B>A</B>
has no associated graphic object. This can either be because the anchor has
not yet been requested by the user or the graphic object has been discarded
from memory. When child <B>B1</B> is created, pointing to parent <B>A</B>,
parent <B>B</B> is registered in parent <B>A</B> as pointing to <B>A</B>.
The same is the case for the link between child <B>BL</B> and <B>A2</B>,
but parent <B>B</B> is only registered once in parent <B>A</B> (this is marked
with <EM>b</EM> in the figure). The same is the case for the links marked
<EM>a</EM> and <EM>c</EM>. A child can have more than one link to other anchors
as indicated in child <B>BL</B>. This is often the case using the POST method,
where for example the same data object is to posted to a News group, a mailing
list and a HTTP server.
<H2>
  6. Implementation of the HTTP Module
</H2>
<P>
The HTTP client is based on the HTTP 1.0 specification but is backwards
compatible with version 0.9. The major difference between this and previous
implementations is that this version is a state machine based on the state
diagram illustrated in <A HREF="#HTTP">Figure 5</A>. As will be discussed
in <A HREF="#MultiSec">Section 8</A>, the state-machine design has some inherent
advantages which makes it suitable in a multi-threaded environment, even
though the HTTP protocol is stateless by nature.
<P>
<A NAME="HTTP"><IMG ALT="[HTTP]" SRC="HTTP"></A>
<P>
The individual states and the transitions between them are explained below.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Begin</B>
  <DD>
    This state is the initial state where the HTTP module sets up the required
    data structures needed for handling the request.
  <DT>
    <B>Need Connection</B>
  <DD>
    The HTTP client is ready for setting up a connection to the remote host.
    The connection is always initiated by a connect system call. This procedure
    has been optimized by using a cache of visited host names as will be explained
    in <A HREF="#CacheSec">Section 7</A>.
  <DT>
    <B>Need Request</B>
  <DD>
    After connection establishment, the module sends the HTTP request to the
    remote server. The request consists of an HTTP header line, a set of MIME
    Headers, and possibly a data object to be posted to the server. Current methods
    supported in the module are GET and HEAD, but support for PUT and POST is
    under development. The supported MIME-headers are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<EM>Accept:</EM> The current implementation uses one accept line for each
	MIME-type supported by the client. For advanced clients this means that the
	"Accept:" sequence is repeated 20-30 times which gives a overhead of 200-300
	bytes per request (including the CRLF telnet EOL-sequence). This should be
	changed so that either a comma separated list is transmitted instead or only
	the MIME content types without any subtypes.
      <LI>
	<EM>Referer:</EM> If any parent anchor is known to the requested URI it is
	sent in the referer field. This is to let the server know what link has led
	to the current request. Nothing is sent if the parent anchor is unknown or
	does not exist.
      <LI>
	<EM>From:</EM> The full email address is sent along the request. It is meant
	as an informative service to the recipient and can be changed to any value
	the user wishes to sign the request with. As it is possible to manipulate
	the email address, this field can not be used as identity verification for
	access authentication.
      <LI>
	<EM>User-Agent:</EM> The user agent is by many clients currently generated
	in a somewhat verbose format. The goal is to make this field machine readable
	so it can be used on the server side to perform individual actions as a function
	of the client implementation. As a side effect it can also be used for statistics
	etc.
      <LI>
	<EM>Authorization:</EM> If the user already has typed in a user ID and a
	password for access authorization in a previous HTTP request the HTTP client
	also transmits the authorization MIME-header. However, this does not guarantee
	that the user ID and password are sufficient for actually accessing the requested
	resource.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    <B>Sent Request</B>
  <DD>
    The client waits until a response is given from the server or the connection
    is timed out in case of an error situation. The client is capable of
    differentiating HTTP 0.9 responses from HTTP 1.0 responses.
  <DT>
    <B>Need Access Authorization</B>
  <DD>
    If a 401 Unauthorized status code is returned, the module prompts the user
    for a user ID and a password. The connection is closed before the user is
    actually asked, so any new request initiated upon a 401 status code causes
    a new connection to be established.
  <DT>
    <B>Redirection</B>
  <DD>
    The module supports both a temporarily (302) and a permanent (301) redirection
    code returned from the server. In both cases, the connection is closed and
    the Protocol Manager is called recursively until a document is found, an
    error has occurred, or the maximum number of redirections has been reached.
    The URI returned in the redirection response from the remote server is parsed
    back to the client via the Error and Information Manager. If it is a 301
    code, an intelligent client can use this information to change the document
    in which the redirected URI originates.
  <DT>
    <B>Need Body</B>
  <DD>
    If a body is included in the response from the server, the module reads the
    data from the network and direct it to the Stream Manager which sets up a
    stream stack to handle the desired format conversion.
  <DT>
    <B>Got Data</B>
  <DD>
    When the data object has been loaded from the Internet, the module terminates
    the request and handles control back to the client.
  <DT>
    <B>Error or Failure</B>
  <DD>
    If at any point in the request handling an error occurs the request is aborted
    and the connection closed. All information about the error is parsed back
    to the client via the Error and Information Manager. As the HTTP protocol
    is stateless, all errors are fatal between the server and the client. If
    the erroneous request is to be corrected, the state machine jumps back to
    the initial state.
</DL>
<P>
<A NAME="CacheSec"></A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="CacheSec">7. Cache of Host Names</A>
</H2>
<P>
As excessive communication with Domain Name Servers (DNS) can produce a
significant time-overhead, a new memory cache of host names have been implemented
to limit the amount of requests to DNS. Once a host name has been resolved
into an IP-address, it is stored in the cache. The entry stays in the cache
until an error occurs when connecting to the remote host or it is removed
during garbage collection. Multi-homed hosts are treated specially as all
available IP-addresses returned from DNS are stored in the cache. Every time
a request is made to the host, the time-to-connect is measured and a weight
function is calculated to indicate how fast the IP-address was. The weight
function used is
<P>
<IMG ALT="[Equation]" SRC="Equation">
<P>
where <IMG ALT=[alpha]" SRC="alpha""> indicates the sensitivity of the function
and <IMG ALT="[Delta]" SRC="Delta"> is the connect time. If one IP-address
is not reachable a penalty of x seconds is added to the weight where the
penalty is a function of the error returned from the "connect" call. The
next time a request is initiated to the remote host, the IP-address with
the smallest weight is used. A problem with both the host cache and the document
cache (either on server side or client side) is to detect when two URLs are
equivalent. The only way this can be done internally in the Library is to
canonicalize the URLs before they are compared. This has for some time been
done by looking at the path segment of the URLs and remove redundant information
by converting URLs like
<PRE>
	foo/./bar/ = foo/redundant/../bar/ = foo/bar/
</PRE>
<P>
The method is now optimized and expanded so that also host names are
canonicalized. Hence the following URLs are all recognized to be identical:
<PRE>
	http://info/ = http://info.cern.ch:80/ = http://INFO.CeRn.CH/ =
	http://info.cern.ch./ = http://info.cern.ch/
</PRE>
<P>
However, the canonicalization does not recognize alias host names which would
require that this information is stored in the cache. <A NAME="MultiSec"></A>
<H2>
  <A NAME="MultiSec">8. Support for Multi-threaded I/O Operation</A>
</H2>
<P>
In a single-process, single-threaded environment all requests to, e.g., the
I/O interface traditionally block any further processing. However, a combination
of a multi-process or multi-threaded implementation makes provision for the
user to request several independent URIs at the same time without getting
blocked by slow I/O operations. As a World-Wide Web client is expected to
use much of the execution time doing I/O operation such as "connect" and
"read", a high degree of optimization can be obtained if multiple threads
can run at the same time. This section describes the current implementation
of multiple threads in the HTTP Module. Later it is expected that other protocol
modules are added. The NNTP, Gopher, and FTP module have all been rewritten
as state machines so they can with minor changes be included in the event-loop.
<H3>
  8.1 Platform Independent Implementation
</H3>
<P>
The major concern in the design of the multi-threaded Library has been to
make a platform independent implementation which excludes use of traditional
thread packages like DECthreads. IEEE has publicized the POSIX standard 1003.4
for multi-threaded programming but even this will eventually limit the
portability referring to the discussion in <A HREF="#ConcernSec">Section
2</A>. Instead, the multi-threaded functionality of the HTTP client has been
designed to be used in a single-processor, single-threaded environment as
illustrated in <A HREF="#Thread">Figure 6</A>
<P>
<A NAME="Thread"><IMG ALT="[Thread]" SRC="Thread"></A>
<P>
The difference between this technique and "traditional" threads is that all
information about a thread is stored in a data object which exists throughout
the lifetime of the thread. This implies that the following rules must be
kept regarding memory management:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Global variables can be used only if they at all time are independent of
    the current state of the active thread.
  <LI>
    Automatic variables can be used only if they are initialized on every entry
    to the function and stay state independent of the current thread throughout
    their lifetime.
  <LI>
    All information necessary for completing a thread must be kept in an autonomous
    data object that is passed round the control flow via the stack.
</UL>
<P>
These rules makes it possible to imply a multi-threaded data model using
only one stack without causing portability problems as it is all done in
plain C.
<H3>
  8.2 Modes of Operation
</H3>
<P>
In order to keep the functionality of the Library as general as possible,
three different modes of operation are implemented:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Base Mode</B>
  <DD>
    This mode is strictly single-threaded. The difference between this mode and
    the other two is that all sockets are made blocking instead of non-blocking.
    The mode preserves compatibility with World-Wide Web applications with a
    single-threaded approach. Currently this mode does not provide interruptible
    I/O as this is a integral part of the event-loop.
  <DT>
    <B>Active Mode</B>
  <DD>
    In this mode the event-loop is placed in the Library. This mode is for dumb
    terminal clients which can interrupt the execution through the keyboard.
    The client can, however, still be multi-threaded in the sense that it can
    actively pre-fetch documents not yet requested by the user. If a key is hit,
    the Library calls a call-back function in the client so the client can decide
    whether the current operation should be interrupted or not. If so, the Library
    stops all I/O activity and handles the execution back to the client. The
    active mode should cause only minor changes to the client in order to obtain
    a simple form of multiple threads and interruptible I/O.
  <DT>
    <B>Passive mode</B>
  <DD>
    This mode requires the most advanced clients, for example GUI clients. The
    event-loop is now placed outside the Library. On every URI request from the
    client, the Library initiates the connection and as soon as it normally would
    block, it returns a list of active socket descriptors to the client. When
    the client is notified about an event on a socket, it calls a Library
    socket-handler passing the socket number. Then the socket handler finds the
    corresponding request and starts the thread. As soon as the thread would
    perform a blocking I/O operation, the socket handler stops the thread and
    returns the execution to the client event-loop.

  8.3 Control Flow
</H3>
<P>
A consequence of having multiple threads in the Library is that the control
flow changes to be event driven where any action is initiated by an event
either caused by the client or the network interface. However, as the current
implementation of multiple threads is valid for HTTP access only, the control
flow of the Library from <A HREF="#Library">Figure 1</A> has been preserved
but with the addition of an event-loop in the HTTP module. All other access
schemes still use blocking I/O and the user will not notice any difference
from the current implementation. The result of this is that full multi-threaded
functionality is enabled only if the client uses consecutive HTTP requests.
The internal event-loop is based on call-back functions and events on a set
of registered socket descriptors as illustrated in <A HREF="#EventLoop">Figure
7</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="EventLoop"><IMG ALT="[EventLoop]" SRC="EventLoop"></A>
<P>
The event-loop handles two kinds of call back functions: Ones that are internal
Library functions such as the specific protocol modules, and the ones that
require an action taken by the client application.
<H3>
  8.4 Interrupting a HTTP Request
</H3>
<P>
The interrupt handler implemented for active mode is non-eager as it is a
part of the select function in the socket event-loop. That is, an interrupt
through standard input is caught when the executing thread is about to execute
a blocking I/O operation such as read from the Internet and execution is
handled back to the event-loop. The reason for this is that the user is not
blocked even though the interrupt does not get caught right away so it is
not as critical as in a single-threaded environment. In passive mode the
client has complete control over when to catch interrupts from the user and
also how and when to handle them.

  9. Conclusions and Future Developments
</H2>
<P>
The Library of Common Code has recently gone through a phase of heavy code
development and set of new features are either being developed or is already
available in the <A HREF="../../">current version</A>. However, in order
to have any effect on the general evolution of the World-Wide Web project,
much work must still be put into the development and maintenance of the code.
Furthermore it is vital that World-Wide Web developers see the Library as
a powerful tool that offers a wide spectrum of functionality relevant to
World-Wide Web applications. The functionality must span fundamental World-Wide
Web features as well as experimental implementations such as gateways and
format converters. We believe that the only way this can be achieved is by
cooperation between the developers and the WWW-team at CERN which has the
responsibility of organizing and synchronizing development on the Library.
Therefore, the goal of this paper is to show the current state of the Library
and at the same time to invite interested parties to join the working group
for future developments. Some of the plans for new features are
<UL>
  <LI>
    Security encryption and authentication
  <LI>
    New MIME-parser which replaces a large number of small sub-parsers
  <LI>
    Implementing general support for Put and Post methods for HTTP, NNTP, and
    SMTP
  <LI>
    Implementation of forms support
  <LI>
    Integrating a WhoIs++ module as a new URI access scheme
  <LI>
    Gateway to a Hyper-G server as a new access scheme
</UL>

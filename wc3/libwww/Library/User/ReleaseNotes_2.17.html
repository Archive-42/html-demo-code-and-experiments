<H2>New and Changed Features</H2>

<UL>

<LI><a name="hc">The host-cache is now extended so that it tries <EM>all</EM>
IP-addresses before it fails the request. It always starts with the
fastest IP-address.  Different penalty is added to the connect times
dependent of the errno returned from <CODE>connect()</CODE>.</a>

<LI>In addition to HTSimplify which canonicalizes the URL path, a new
function now canonicalizes the host-part of the URL. This means that
URLs like

<PRE>
	http://info/ = http://www.w3.org:80/ = http://INFO.CeRn.CH/ =
	http://www.w3.org. = http://www.w3.org/
</PRE>

now all are treated identical. This is useful for all the caches
based on URLs such like the Server document cache and the hostname
cache

<LI>TRACE is now differentiated into a bit flag so that TRACE messages
can be turned on and off for individual groups of messages. This was
necessary as the amount of verbose output was growing too much

<LI>Redirection understands now `URI:' and `Location:'. Implemented
after discussion on www-talk

<LI>Changed 404 Error Message to `Access Forbidden'. The URL is no more
included in the message as it is sensitive information

<LI>FTP client now sends full email address of the user as the password
for anonymous access instead of USER@. This allows access to some servers
which don't accept the old format

<LI>The data connection in a FTP session is now based on the return
value sent by the PASV return code rather than the URL. It is not
always the case that the data connection is on the same host as the 
control connection

<LI>UserID and Passwd in FTP URLs can now contain special characters,
like '@' etc.

<LI>The Gopher listings are now slightly lighter and don't contain the
`name' and `files' any more

<LI>Support of Gopher info items. They are treated as normal messages.
The gopher code for this is `i'

<LI>WAIS module now guesses the stream format when TEXT is returned from
the WAIS library as it might be HTML.

<LI>The Protocol modules: FTP, WAIS, and Gopher now produce proper HTML
with <HTML><HEAD> etc. in the beginning

<LI>Added a function that returns the domain name taken from the same 
location as HTGetHostName(). The functionality of obtaining current
host names, mail addresses etc. have improved, see HTTCP.html for more

<LI>Introduced the flag HTInteractive in HTAccess.html to tell whether
functions in HTAlert can prompt the User from within the Library or
not. Default is YES.

<LI>The common BUILD for the Line Mode Browser, the CERN Server and the Library
of common code now accepts a command line option:

<PRE>
	BUILD linemode | daemon | library
</PRE>

to build a specific component. The default action is to build all three
parts. BUILD is now also provided in a Bourne Shell version

</UL>


<H2>Bug Fixes</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Fixed memory leak in HTWAIS Doc retrieval. However, the
functionality or performance has not changes

<LI>If no host is found in the URL then no attempt is made to connect
to host 0.0.0.0 that is localhost. Some hosts do have an alias for
this address

<LI>Fixed free memory read in redirections. Put redirection counter
into request structure. Now no more than (default) 10 redirections are
allowed

<LI>Fixed bug in FTP module to handle really slow hosts in the select
call. The select timed out without the right action taken.

<LI>FTP module chopped off the first line of a Windows NT ftp server as
it doesn't send a traditional first UNIX line. Fixed! Well, it
<EM>did</EM> look like UNIX, but no more than that :-(

<LI>Problem in HTTeXGen. Some markups was spread over a new line, and
LaTeX doesn't like that.

<LI>Remove the <CODE>ACCESS_AUTH</CODE> define as it is never used
anymore (no more compilation without access authentication)

<LI>Fixed bug in the ISO Latin 1 translation table in HTML.c. This was
a problem for estonian documents or other with many special characters

<LI>Fixed bug in HTSimplify not skipping host names. HTSimplify is
made faster and is now only called once (both from the server and the
client). Before it was called 2-3 times.

<LI>Bug found in FTP URLs containing UserID and Passwd fixed

<LI>Bug fixed in name generation in client cache

<LI>Removed bug in FTP and IP-rotation on multi-homed hosts. When FTP
server is in PASV mode it sends back a port number on a specific host.
In this case we can't use IP-address rotation.

<LI>Bug with FTP IP-address network order fixed for PASV mode

<LI>Gopher errors (code 3) are now just put as a string as they are
not <B>real</B> error

<LI>Bug fixed in HTWriter.c function <CODE>flush()</CODE> where a
partial success in NETWRITE would produce a wrong output (repeated
buffer)

</UL>

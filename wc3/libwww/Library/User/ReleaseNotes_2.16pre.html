<H3>New Features and Changed Interfaces</H3>

<H4>HTTP Client</H4>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/HTTP.html">HTTP</A> module contains the code
for the HTTP client. The module is now reorganized and made more modular.

<DL> 
<DT> Automatic Redirection
<DD> Now supported by the HTTP Module. The name of the new URL is parsed
     to the client via the error_stack as a ERR_INFO message, see
     <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTError.html">HTError</A> module. The maximum
     number of redirections is set by the variable HTMaxRedirections.
<DT> Referer Field in HTTP request
<DD> Clients are provided the possibility of
     sending a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z14">Referer Field</A> in a <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html">HTTP Request</A>. This is done by
     filling out the HTRequest-&gt;parentAnchor field.
<DT> From field in HTTP Request
<DD> Clients can now send the full email address of the current user in the
     <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#from">HTTP From field</A>. The feature is turned off by default as it might
     get a bit tricky through a Proxy.
<DT> 204 Response
<DD> Support of return code `204 No Response'
</DL>

<H4>FTP Client</H4>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFTP.html">HTFTP</A> module contains the code for
the FTP client. The FTP client has changed a lot in this release. It is now a
complete state machine where the actual action executed is a function of the
current state.

<UL>
<LI> The client now follows the suggestions given in rfc 1123: "Requirements
     for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support".
<LI> Establishment of the data connection now comply to rfc 1579: "Firewall-
     friendly FTP" such that the procedure is
	<OL>
		<LI> try PASV
		<LI> if that fails, try PORT
	</OL>	
<LI> The URL is now parsed according to the (latest)
     <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/URL/4_1_FTP.html">
     specifications</A>:
<PRE>
	url	: f t p: / / login / path [  ftptype ]
	login	: [ user [ : password ] @ ] hostport
	hostport: host [ : port ]  
	ftptype	: A formcode | E formcode | I | L digits
	formcode:  N | T | C
</PRE>
<LI> Both directory listings and file retrieval use the same procedure:
<OL> 
<LI> First try to go to the location directly, as we are often talking
     to a UNIX server or one that 'understands' UNIX syntax
<LI> If it fails, then go to the location step by step using CWD. In
     that way we should not have any problems on any platform, and
     thus it is not necessary to make special hacks for VMS, etc.
</OL> 
<LI> Long directory listings are supported for unix-like systems and VMS. This
     includes NetWare and WindowsNT. See <A HREF="Bugs/Workinglist.html">Future plans</A> 
     for more and <A HREF="#z20">Directory Listings</A>
<LI> Information from the FTP-server is pr default presented to the client
     using the following rule:
<OL> 
<LI> If you are connecting to the root directory at a ftp site, we show the
     'login' message (might be a concatenation of several messages) just
     like in a normal ftp session.
<LI> If you have a more specific URL, then you probably already know the site  
     and are less interested in the login message. Instead we show any local  
     message when making a CWD to the right location.
</OL> 
</UL>

<H4>Gopher Client</H4>

The <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTGopher.html">Gopher</A> has been revised and 
improved error handling has been implemented.

<DL>
<DT> Information Messages
<DD> Some Gopher servers send back information messages in a line containing
     "error.host". This information is treated like login information from FTP
     servers so that it is represented as a message before or after the actual
     listing.
<DT> Iconized Listings
<DD> Listings now contain icons in the same way as the other listings.
<DT> CSO Name Server
<DD> The CSO Name Server client outputs in HTML and not only &lt;PRE&gt; as
     before.
<DT> Content Type Recognition
<DD> The Gopher module uses it's own content-type recognition inherited from 
     HTTP when handling gopher text and gopher binary files. This means, that
     e.g. PostScript files get handled correctly.
</DL>

<H4>Local File Access</H4>

The new version of HTFile module is a lot smaller as all Directory listing
stuff has moved to HTDirBrw module. New error handling has been implemented.

<H4>Passive and Active Connection Establishment</H4>

Calls to connect() and accept() now go through the functions HTDoConnect()
and HTDoAccept() respectively.

<H4>Cache of Host Names and Addresses</H4>

HTInetParse() that is called from within HTDoConnect now has an internal cache
of the names and (possible multiple) IP-addresses of visited hosts. This
minimizes the access to the file /etc/hosts and the Domain Name Server, even
though aliases are not recognized in the cache.<P>

The default cache size is 500 entries and a host stays as long as a connect()
succeeds. That is, if connection is refused for some reason, the host is taken
out of the cache. <P>

The time to make a connection to a multihomed host is measured every time and
a mean access time is calculated so that HTDoConnect always takes the fastest
IP-address, see <A HREF="Bugs/Workinglist.html">Future plans</A>.

<H4>Improved Functionality of DNS requests</H4>

The Library now provides functionality for obtaining the full mail address
of the user, full domain name of the host and also the possibility for
setting both values. This means that the user can use his official email
address, e.g. in the HTTP request.

<H4><A NAME="z20">Long Directory Listings</A></H4>

Long directory listings for HTTP, FTP and files on the local file
system supported. For the moment only a part of
the functionality, e.g, sorting, which columns to show etc. is exploited, see <A HREF="Bugs/Workinglist.html">Future Plans</A>.

<H4>Icon Management</H4>

Icons in directory listings are bound to MIME content-types and encoding. They
can be found in the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTIcons.html">HTIcons</A> 
module. The default set of icons is set up using HTStdIconInit() and new 
icons can be added dynamicly using HTAddIcon().

<H4>File Descriptions in Directory Listings</H4>

File descriptions are supported for long HTTP directory listings. The default
thing is to peek the title of the HTML files.

<H4>Error and Information Message Management</H4>

A new error handling module is introduced in <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTError.html"></A>HTError. It uses the error_stack entry in the
<A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest structure</A>. It
handles nested error messages so that we can give a reason for the error, e.g.
<PRE>
    Error in ...
        This error occurred because ...
            This is caused by ...
                etc.
</PRE>

It also makes it possible for the Library to pass information back to the
client so that the the Library doesn't act like a `black hole'. An example is
HTTP redirection with status code `Moved 301'. Now the new URL is parsed back
to the client via the error_stack so that the client can update the reference
when possible. <P>

The function that generates and outputs the error messages to the user is put
into <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTErrorMsg.c">HTErrorMsg Module</A> so that it can be overwritten by a smart client or
server.

<H4>Guessing the Content Type of a Stream</H4>

The HTGuess module reads a part a stream and determines the content type with 
the highest probability from a statistical analysis.

<H4>Minor Stuff</H4>

<DL>
<DT> tmpnam() 
<DD> Because of problems on NeXT platforms the tmpnam() function is now
     replaced by HTFWriter_filename() in HTFWriter.c. The function has two
     modes: Give back a hash name or the last part of the URL (which
     normally is more readable).
<DT> HTMLPutImg()
<DD> New function to make it easier to put out an HTML &lt;IMG&gt; tag.
<DT> HTParseInet()
<DD> Added one more parameter to tell whether it is a multihomed host or not.
     (This is used in the host cache).
<DT> HTInetStatus()
<DD> Should no more be used directly but is called from HTErrorAdd so that the
     message goes all the way back to the user
<DT> HTError
<DD> This typedef is now obsolete and will be removed in future releases
<DT> HTLoad()
<DD> Added new parameter to HTLoad: BOOL keep_error_stack. If YES then the 
     error_stack is not cleared. This is used in redirection etc.
<DT> HTLoadError()
<DD> Because of the new <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTError.html">HTError</A>
     module, this function in HTML.c is not needed anymore.
</DL>

<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

This is a list of fixed bugs from earlier versions.

<UL>
<LI> Memory faults in HTSimplify() in HTParse.c has been fixed
<LI> README files in directory listings now know how to handle '&lt;', '&gt;'
     and '&amp;' correctly. Though the file still has to be Ascii. See
     <A HREF="Bugs/Workinglist.html">future plans</A> for handling this file.
<LI> tmpnam is no more used in the Library because of problems on NeXT
     platform. Instead a new function called HTFWriter_filename() in
     HTFWriter.c is written. 
<LI> HTInputSocket_getCharacter now returns a int and not a char so that EOF
     is no longer a member of the char set.
<LI> HTMLGen_start_element() is only allowed to put extra '\n' in &lt;PRE&gt;
     mode if it is between parameters in a tag
<LI> Changed type of &lt;IMG&gt; into SGML_EMPTY so that it doesn't expect
     end tag &lt;\IMG&gt;
<LI> Nested &lt;PRE&gt; is no more a problem in HTMLGen_start_element.
<LI> Removed all #elif as not all compilers on HPUX likes it.
<LI> Changed HTChunk such that chunk-&gt;data is '\0' terminated at any time.
     This actually makes HTChunkTerminate less needed but be aware that
     HTChunk-&gt;size changes.
<LI> Removed non-portable d_namlen field in HTMulti.
<LI> Moved definition of NO_GROUPS to tch.html
<LI> Moved definition of HT_MAX_PATH to tch.html
<LI> Proxy server now closes connection in HTTP.c. This was only problem in
     non-forking servers (VMS).
<LI> Definition of HT_NO_DATA moved to HTUtils.html where the other
     return codes are placed.
<LI> Functions from <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAlert.html">HTAlert Module</A> that prompt the user don't get 
     confused about <EM>ctrl-D</EM> anymore.

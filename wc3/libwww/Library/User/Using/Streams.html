  The Stream Class
</H1>
<P>
The Stream class defines objects which accepts a sequence of characters.
Streams may also have an output in which case multiple stream objects can
be cascaded to build a stream pipe where the output of a stream is directed
into the input of the next stream object "down the line". Of course, one
of the main features of streams is that they can perform a <I>data conversion
</I>on the data before piping it to the output. As multiple streams may be
cascaded, the complete data conversion is then the sum of each individual
data conversion performed by the stream objects being part of the stream
pipe.
<P>
It is not <I>required</I> that a stream has a target, it might as well be
a black hole that just accepts data without ever giving it out again. The
generic stream class is subclassed multiple places in the Library and a good
example is the <A HREF="../../src/HTStruct.html">structured stream
definition</A> which creates a SGML object.
<P>
All stream class methods return an integer status code telling whether the
operation succeeded or not.. This is the way for a stream to pass control
information upstream to the caller which may also be a stream.

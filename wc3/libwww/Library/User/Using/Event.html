<h1>The Event Manager</h1>

<p>The <a href="../../src/HTEvent.html">Event Manager</a> defines the API to
any event loop to be used by libwww for handling events. An <i>event</i> is
not strictly defined as it is highly platform dependent and considered out of
scope for libwww.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../src/WWWCore.html">libwww core</a> does <em>not</em>
define any event loop - this is considered part of the application. However,
in the <a href="../../src/WWWApp.html">libwww application module</a>, you will
find <a href="../../src/HTEvtLst.html">two default event loops</a>: one for
Unix and one or Windows. They are normally initialized using the <a
href="../../src/HTProfil.html">libwww profiles</a> which help you setting up
libwww for your particular needs.</p>

<p>Libwww is <em>not</em> currently thread safe - it supports what I call
pseudo threads which are timed on I/O operations - that is, libwww works very
much like X.</p>

<p>If your application is not using anything but traditional blocking sockets
then you do not need an event manager at all. In that case, libwww will block
on any socket or system call until the process can proceed. It is important to
note that certain operations like <a href="../../src/HTAccess.html">HTTP PUT
and POST</a>, for example, require non-blocking sockets.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../src/HTEvent.html">libwww event interface</a> is very
simple, it consists of two operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>registering</b> a <i>socket descriptor</i> together with the
<i>location</i> in the program, and the <i>current state</i> of the operation
(for example <code>read</code>). When the event manager at a later point in
time gets a notification that the socket has become ready, it can then call
libwww with the state saved from the registration and libwww can continue.
</li>
<li>
<b>unregistering</b> a <em>socket descriptor</em> when it is not anymore in a
state where it can block.
</li>
</ol>

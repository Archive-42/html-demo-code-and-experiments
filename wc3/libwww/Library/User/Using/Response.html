  The Response Class
</H1>
<P>
The response object is created as a placeholder for the response received
by the remote server. All filters can use the information stored in the response
and act appropriately. This is often used by the AFTER filters which can
handle authentication, redirection, etc. See the filter section for more
information on this.
<P>
The Response object is created automatically when we start to receive
metainformation (for example MIME headers) and bound to the
<A HREF="Request.html">Request</A> object. The Response object is deleted
automatically when the corresponding request object is deleted but it can
of course be deleted before if this is desired.
<P>
Note that is using non-blocking sockets then libwww essentially behaves
asynchronously as you may issue multiple requests and get back the responses
out of order as they appear on the net interface.

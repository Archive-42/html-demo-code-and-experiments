  Bindings to the local File system
</H1>
<P>
The preferences that we described in section <A HREF="Prefs.html">Request
Preferences</A> did not mention what libwww should do if it doesn't know
the data format of a document. In many protocols this information is provided
by the remote server. Typical examples are MIME like protocols where the
metainformation such as the <EM>Content-Type</EM> and the
<EM>Content-Language</EM> is provided together with the document. However,
applications often have access to the local file system using <B>file</B>
URLs which in general do not keep any or at least very little information
of the file type. It is therefore required to have some kind of binding between
the file system and the preferences registered in the Library which provides
this mateinformation about the object.
<P>
Often files in a file system is classified by some sort of a suffix, for
example GIF files are often ending in <EM>.gif</EM>, text files in
<EM>.txt</EM> etc. This binding is not static and it is therefore required
to have a dynamic binding just like the preferences themselves. An example
of the latter is HTML files which on most Unix systems end in <EM>.html</EM>
whereas they on many MS-DOS based systems end in <EM>.htm</EM>.
<P>
The <A HREF="../../src/HTBind.html">HTBind module</A> provides a generic
binding mechanism between a file and its representation internally in libwww.
It is not limited to simple file suffix classification but can also be used
in more advanced environments using data bases etc. However, at this point
we are interested in how we can register bindings between file suffixes and
for example content types, content languages etc. The Bind manager is born
with a certain knowledge about the set of delimiters but more can be added
to provide the functionality desired.

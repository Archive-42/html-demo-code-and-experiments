  Before and After Filters
</H1>
<P>
Until now we have not mentioned a lot about what the Library actually
<I>can</I> do. The fact is that the <A HREF="../../src/WWWCore.html">core
part </A>of libwww actually doesn't do much. All the functionality must be
registered by the application - in other words - the application programmer
builds a <A HREF="../../src/HTProfil.html">libwww profile</A> for an application
by registering a specific set of protocol modules, callbacks and filters.
Filters are called <I>before</I> a request is to be issued to the Network,
and <I>after</I> when the request has terminated.
<P>
All filters are registered at run-time, and filters can be cascaded so that
one filter can call other filters and so on. Filters can also start new requests
or terminate existing requests, so the set of possibilities is very big.
Normally, filters do only handle metainformation about a resource. For example,
the authentication filters looks to see if we have been asked to provide
some credentials in order to access a URL. If so then it adds a protocol
defined header to the request, and if not then the request just proceeds.
Handling the actual data object is done by <A HREF="Streams.html">streams</A>
which can &nbsp;modify the contents of a data object.
<P>
The Library can handle local and global filters - local filters are associated
with a single request and global filters are associated with all requests.
That is, if you can decorate a request with a specialized filter or you can
use a generalized filter for handling all requests. A global filter is useful
if the filter is to be performed very often and local filters can either
add to or override the global set of filters.
<P>
Often, a before and an after filter needs to share a context which is unique
to this set of filters. There are various ways this can be handled by the
Library. Either a context can associated at registration time or it can be
built while the filters are run. The <A HREF="../../src/HTUTree.html">URL
tree</A> is a useful data object for keeping information associated with
realms or sets of URLs.
<H2>
  Use the Standard Filters
</H2>
<P>
The libwww distribution package comes with a large set of
<A HREF="../../src/HTFilter.html">standard filters</A>. These are filters
that can be used in most applications and will do 80% of the job. The
<A HREF="../../src/HTFilter.html">standard filters </A>cover the following
functions
<UL>
  <LI>
    Proxy and Gateway redirection
  <LI>
    Memory and Persistent cache
  <LI>
    Rule Files
  <LI>
    Logging
  <LI>
    Error Message Generation
  <LI>
    Redirection
  <LI>
    Authentication
</UL>
<H2>
  When the Standard Filters Aren't Enough
</H2>
<P>
In some situations, you can not use the standard filters, for example if
you want to get very specific information out of the request or want to interact
more actively. For example if you want to keep track of all the redirections
performed by the redirection filter then the only way is to roll your own
filter. However, the filter mechanism provides the application writer with
a powerful method for extending the functionality of the application at runtime
and can be used for many different extensions.
<P>
Filters can also be nested - that is for example the case of authentication
filters and PEP filters. For example, the authentication filter before and
after filter are generalized authentication filters that do not know about
specific schemes like basic authentication. However, the authentication filters
contain a mechanism for registering specific authentication filters like
basic and digest, and it will look at the information in the URL tree to
see what authentication scheme to call for a particular request.

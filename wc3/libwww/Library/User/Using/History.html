  Keeping Track of History
</H1>
<P>
Libwww supports client applications in keeping track of which locations the
user has visited while browsing the Web. The history manager is implemented
in the <A HREF="../../src/HTHist.html">HTHist module</A>. This module is
completely autonomous as it is not used by any other modules in libwww so
if it is not referred to in the application code then it will not be linked
into the linked application. This means that if the application does not
need recording of history then no action is required at all.
<P>
The purpose of the history manager is to try not to impose any particular
history mechanism policy but instead to allow various different history
mechanisms. The basic features of the history module are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The module can handle multiple history lists
  <LI>
    The underlying data model is linear lists
  <LI>
    The module keeps a position pointer into this list
  <LI>
    The application can refer to an element in the list by an index
</UL>
<P>
Some of the navigation steps supported by the module are "back", "forward",
and jump to a position in the list. 
<P>
The details of the module is listed in the declaration part of the
<A HREF="../../src/HTHist.html">HTHist module</A>.

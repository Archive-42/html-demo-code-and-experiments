<H1>Configuration</H1>

The architecture of the Library is very flexible and it can be
configured for many purposes. It has the advantage that you can set up
exactly the configuartion needed for your application but also the
disadvantage that it might seeem difficult to use. This section is
supposed to describe what you can configure and how it can be
done. There are several ways of configuring the Library:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#setenv">Environment Variables</A>
<LI><A HREF="#proxy">Proxies and Gateways</A>
<LI><A HREF="#flags">Setting flags to specify behavior of the Library</A>
<LI><A HREF="#init">Static/dynamic initialization of Library Modules</A>
<LI><A HREF="#stram">Set up the Stream Interface</A>
<LI><A HREF="#Overwrite">Write your own modules to replace Library modules</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="setenv"><H2>Environment Variables</H2></A>

The Library supports a set of environment variables (or what's
equivalent on your platform). <EM><A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/EnvVariables.html">Environment
variable</A></EM> is a Unix term. On VMS you should use a <EM><A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/Installation_VMS.html#3">logical
name</A></EM>. These are used to determine the default start up page,
what <A HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/AboutNewsServers.html">News
server</A> to use, whether we should use a <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Proxies/Proxies.html">Proxy server</A> or a <A
HREF="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html">WWW Gateway</A> when requesting a
document. <P>

All the environment variables supported by the Library are also
supported by the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode
Browser</A>, and you can find a list of them under the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/Customisation.html">Customization of
the Line Mode Browser</A>


<A NAME="proxy"><H2>Proxies and Gateways</H2></A>

Applications build on top of the Library can be set up to use a proxy
server or a gateway when requesting a document. Using either a proxy
server or a gateway enables you efficiently to enhance the
functionality of any client without changing the code as all requests
between the proxy client and the proxy server (or gateway) are using
HTTP only. <P>

The difference between using a proxy server and a gateway is subtle
but important: In a gateway request, the DNS part but not the access
scheme is sent to the gateway whereas proxy requests include the full
URI. As an example, if we are using a <A
HREF="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html">WAIS gateway</A> and want to get
the following URI:

<PRE>
	wais://quake.think.com?WWW
</PRE>

Then the part sent to a gateway is

<PRE>
	/quake.think.com?WWW
</PRE>

and to a proxy server

<PRE>
	wais://quake.think.com?WWW
</PRE>

Proxy servers have precedence over gateways, so if both a proxy server
and a gateway has been defined for an access scheme, then the proxy
server is used. You can set up the Library to use either a proxy
server or a gateway is done using <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/EnvVariables.html">environment
variables</A> as described in <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/User/Proxies/ProxyClients.html">Setting up a
Proxy Client</A>.

<A NAME="flags"><H2>Configuration Flags</H2></A>

Many modules have a global set of variables/flags that can be used to
modify the behavior of the modules. There is on general rule that
applies to what is configurable, but it is all described in the
individual modules, so please look into the declaration files to see
what flags exist. An example is how to specify <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTDirBrw.html">what a directory listing
should like</A>.


<A NAME="init"><H2>Static and Dynamic Initialization</H2></A>

The <CODE>stream manager</CODE> and the <CODE>protocol manager</CODE>
are both designed in a highly modular style in that they use pointers
to functions when they decide on what protocol or parser to use
respectively. For the <CODE>protocol manager</CODE>, the actual
binding between an access scheme specified in the <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/Addressing.html">URI</A> and the protocol
module used is done in a separate protocol structure which can be
setup at run-time. Likewise for the <CODE>stream manager</CODE> where
the binding is based on <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/0/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">
MIME-types</A>, either found directly in the response code from the
remote server or by guessing. This model makes it very easy to install
new stream converters and protocol modules.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z63" HREF="../../Implementation/HTInit.html">HTInit</A>

<DD>The initialisation module for clients. This modules contains functions to
setup a list of MIME type converters that the client is capable of handling
and a set of bindings between file suffixes and MIME types.  The module may be
replaced in custom clients.

<DT>HTSInit

<DD>The initialisation module for servers. May be replaced for custom
servers. Not part of the library, but part of the server.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTRules.html">HTRule</A>

<DD>The module which reads the configuration file, and does
translation of URLs according to rules. It is currently replaced by <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Implementation/HTConfig.c"> HTConfig Module</A>
in the W3C Server and no rule file is used in the Line Mode Browser
in order to keep it simple.

</DL>

<A NAME="stream"><H2>Set up the Stream Interface</H2></A>

Many of the library modules that output data directly to the client or through
a server can easily be overwritten, e.g, by a GUI client. Below is a list of
moduels that specifically have been propared for this, but other modules can
be overwritten as well. <P>

A client can overwrite the graphic object modules in the Library in
order to take advantage of a more advanced user-interface. The <A
HREF="./#GraphicObject">graphic object</A> has several
interfaces, depending on how much of the Library code the client wants
to handle on its own (on the figure, the more you are to the left, the
more you will have to replace).

<P><IMG SRC="Interfaces.gif"><P>

<DL>

<DT>SGML Stream Interface

<DD>Use this intergace if you do not want to use the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/SGML.html">SGML parser</A> in the Library
and the following transition to a structured stream which is a
subclass of the stream class. This can all be set up with out
overwriting any module but simply by defining the converters not to
use the SGML/HTML parsers.

<DT>HTML Structured Stream Interface

<DD>If the client has its own HTML parser then the interface is
between the client HTML parser and the Library SGML parser. The SGML
parser is a general SGML parser which can be setup with a specific DTD
and it feeds the HTML parser with structured data. In this case, you
will be emulating the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTML.c">HTML
module</A>, and generating a hypertext object from the structured
stream.

<DT>HText Call Back Interface

<DD>If the client wants to use the HTML parser in the Library then
this is the interface to use for the application. The hypertext object
is parsed and the communication with the client is based on a set of
call-back functions in the HTML parser. The call-back functions are
all defined as prototypes in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HText.html">HText module</A> but the client
must provide the actual code that defines the presentation method used
for a specific HTML tag. If you wish to maintain the structure of the
SGML file within your object, then the SGML interface will be a better
place to connect your code.

</DL>

<A NAME="Overwrite"><H2>Modules to Overwrite</H2></A>

When all public functions and variables within a module are
overwritten by module other than the one in the Library, the linker
takes the new version and ignores the module in the Library. The
following modules are implemented in the Library in order to support
the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> but
can be overwritten by GUI clients etc.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTErrMsg.html">HTErrorMsg</A>

<DD>This module generates and formats the messages on the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1"> error stack</A>. If the
application wants it own format for the messages, then this module can
be overwritten.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAlert.html">HTAlert</A>

<DD>See also <A HREF="Utils.html#ErrorAlert">Description of
HTAlert</A>. All communication within the Library to the user goes
through this module. It contains functions for prompting for user name
etc. Obviously this must be overwritten by GUI clients.

<DT><A NAME="z74" HREF="../../Implementation/HTHist.html">HTHistory</A>

<DD>This client module records and replays on request the documents
which the user visits. If the application wants a more advanced
history management, then this should be overwritten.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEvent.html">HTEvent</A>

<DD>This is the internal event loop in the library for multi-threaded
protocol access. See also the description of <A
HREF="../Architecture/Threads.html"> specification of multiple
threads</A>. If an application wants its own event loop, then this
module must be overwritten.

</DL>

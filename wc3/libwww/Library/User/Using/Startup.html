<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This guide assumes that you have already <a
href="../../../INSTALL.html">compiled libwww</a> and are ready to <a
href="../../libwww-config.html">use it building an application</a>. Libwww is
divided into a set of <i><a href="../Guide/">packages</a></i> containing
various part of functionality. They all have a name starting with <em>WWW</em>
- two of them are required to use in all libwww applications, <a
href="../Guide/">the rest</a> is optional:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="../../src/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil</a></dt>
<dd>
The WWW Utility module contains a lot of the functionality that makes it
possible to make applications, that is container modules for data objects,
basic string functionality etc. This module is the basis for all of the
following modules and is used extensively.
</dd>
<dt><a href="../../src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore</a></dt>
<dd>
The WWW Core module is a set of registration modules that glues an application
together. It contains no real functionality in itself; it is for example not
capable of loading an HTML document. It only provides a large set of hooks
which can be used to add functionality to libwww and to give an application
"real life". We will here a lot more to the structure of the core, and much of
this guide is actually describing how to add functionality to the core.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The application must explicitly initialize libwww before it can start using
it so that the internal file descriptors, and variables can be set to their
respective values. This only has to be done once while the application is
running and is typically done when the application is started. The application
also should close down libwww when it has stopped using it - typically when
the application is closing down. Libwww will then return resources like file
descriptors and dynamic memory to the operating system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../../Examples/libapp_1.c">See the starup/shutdown sample app for how
to initialize/terminate libwww</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building your first Application</h2>

<p><em>Note: If you are on Unix and you have installed libwww then you can use
the </em><a href="../../libwww-config.html"><em>libwww-config
script</em></a><em> to make linking against libwww easier. In Windows MSVC you
have to include the DLLs in your application project.</em></p>

<p>The sample app above doesn't do anything whatsoever. There are now two ways
you can go for intializing the features you need in libwww:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Use <a href="../../src/HTProfil.html">libwww profiles</a> which sets up a long
list of often used features for you. See for example the libwww <a
href="../../Examples/LoadToFile.c">'load to file</a>' sample app
</li>
<li>
Go through the <a href="../../src/HTInit.html">initialization routines</a>
yourself. See for example the <a href="../../Examples/tiny.c">tiny browser</a>
sample app
</li>
</ul>

<p>Which method is right for you depends on your application and how much you
want to get your feet wet. If you are in doubt then I would recommend using
profiles.</p>

<h2>Adding Functionality</h2>

<p>Sometimes, profiles are not enough - you may need a combination of features
that is not supported by a default profile. In this case, you may be able to
take one of the profiles and then edit it to suit your needs. You can also
have a look at the <a href="../../Examples/">sample applications</a> to get a
better idea about which profiles can be used for what purposes.</p>

<h2>Fetching a Document from the Web</h2>

<p>Some operations that are often used is to get or save a document on the
Web. There are already several sample applications that do this kind of thing
- I recommend that you have a look at the <a
href="../Applications.html">libwww applications </a>and see whether you can
not start from there.</p>

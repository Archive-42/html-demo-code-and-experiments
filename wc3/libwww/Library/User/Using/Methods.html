  The Protocol Class
</H1>
<P>
Libwww comes with a wide set of protocol modules that gives access to most
popular Internet protocols including HTTP, FTP, Gopher, telnet, rlogin, NNTP
and WAIS. However, as mentioned in the beginning, when the Library is first
initialized it knows nothing about how to access the Internet. In fact it
doesn't even know how to access the local file system. It is for the application
to tell the Library what it can handle and where to go find the functionality.
This is very much the same mechanism as we saw described in the previous
chapter, so a lot of what is going on will hopefully become clear as we go
along.
<P>
All protocol modules are dynamically bound to an access scheme. Take for
example the following URL:
<PRE>	<B>http</B>://www.w3.org/
</PRE>
<P>
It has the access scheme <B>http</B> and if we have a protocol module capable
of handling HTTP then we can make the binding between <B>http</B> and this
module. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the Library already
comes with a large set of protocol module, including HTTP so all we have
to do in this case is to register the HTTP module to the Library as being
capable of handling <B>http</B> URLs.
<P>
One special case is the support for access to
<A HREF="../../../../Products/WAIS/">WAIS</A> databases. WAIS has its own
code Library called <A HREF="http://www.cnidr.org/" >freeWAIS</A> which is
required in order to directly access wais URLs. We shall not describe in
describe in detail here how this can be enabled as it is described in the
<A HREF="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html">the WWW-WAIS gateway</A>.

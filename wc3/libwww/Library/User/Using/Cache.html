  The Cache Manager
</H1>
<P>
Caching is a required part of any efficient Internet access applications
as it saves bandwidth and improves access performance significantly in almost
all types of accesses. The Library supports two different types of cache:
The memory cache and the file cache. The two types differ in several ways
which reflects their two main purposes: The memory cache is for short term
storage of graphic objects whereas the file cache is for intermediate term
storage of data objects. Often it is desirable to have both a memory and
a file version of a cached document, so the two types do not exclude each
other. The following paragraphs explains how the two caches can be maintained
in the Library.

  <A NAME="memcache">Memory Cache</A>
</H3>
<P>
The memory cache is largely managed by the application as it simply consists
of keeping the body part of a document in memory. As the user keeps requesting
new documents it will then be served immediately out of memory. This is a
nice way to keep high performance while browsing back and forward through
the history list. The memory cache is a <I>BEFORE</I> filter that checks
whether the data object was kept in memory or flushed.
<H3>
  Persistent Cache
</H3>
<P>
The file cache is intended for intermediate term storage of documents or
data objects. The libwww cache is a fully HTTP/1.1 compliant client side
cache which honors all HTTP/1.1 cache directives and allows for disconnected
operation. The cache also knows how to handle byte range requests so that
if you abort a download and start it at a later point in time then it will
try to use the part that it already have and only ask for the latter part.
In case the origin server (or any interdiate cache) knows how to handle byte
range requests we then only get the part that we didn't get the first time.

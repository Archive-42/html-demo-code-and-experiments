  The Error Class
</H1>
<P>
The Error class provides an easy API for registering errors occurring while
the Library serves a request. All errors are registered in an "error
stack"&nbsp;in the <A HREF="../../src/HTReq.html">Request object</A> which
allows for nested errors. The Error class is both natural language independent
and application independent in that it uses enumerations in order to refer
to specific errors. It is for the application to provide an error presentation
module which interprets the errors associated with a request. An example
of such an implementation can be found in the
<A HREF="../../src/HTDialog.html">HTDialog module</A>.
<P>
Libwww deals with two categories of errors: application errors and system
errors. The former are all the errors that can occur when libwww is used
in a "real" environment where network connections can disappear, disks can
get full, and memory can get exhausted. The letter type of errors are at
a lower level including invalid arguments passed to procedures, missing function
calls, or any other application misbehavior. In this section we will examine
libwww <A HREF="../../src/HTError.html">Error Manager</A> which handles user
errors. In a later section we will have a look at how to control the application
errors at an application debug level using trace messages.
<P>
As a part of the core libwww, the error object is intended to pass information
about errors and messages occuring in libwww back to the application. Each
error is kept as an object so multiple errors can be nested together using
the well-known <A HREF="../../src/HTList.html">HTList object</A>. Nested
error management can be used to build complicated error messages which an
arbitrary level of details, for example:
<PRE>
	This URL could not be retrieved: http://www.foo.com
	    Reason: The host name could not be resolved
	        Reason: DNS service is not available
</PRE>
<P>
The principle behind the error manager is exactly like any other registration
module in libwww in that it creates an object and binds it to a list that
the caller provides. Often, errors are related to a specific request object
and each request object will therefore keep its own list of errors. However,
errors can also be maintained as separate lists which are not directly related
to a request, for example, the application can keep its own list of errors
independent of any Library errors.
<P>
System errors include all errors that occur while interacting with the operating
system. Often these errors occurs as a result of insufficient availability
or authentication to a system resource. In many operating systems, the system
provides a set of error messages which is associated with an error code made
available to the application via the <EM>errno</EM> variable or equivalent.
All other errors are registered with an error message belonging to libwww
Error manager. Note, that there are no difference in how system errors and
other errors are treated, they are the same data objects and can be registered
together with no exception.

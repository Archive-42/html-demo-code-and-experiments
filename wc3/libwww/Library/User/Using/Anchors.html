  The Anchor Class
</H1>
<P>
An anchor represents a region of a hypertext document which is linked to
another anchor in the same or a different document. Another name for anchors
would be URLs as an anchor represents all we know about a URL - including
where it points to and who points to it.&nbsp;Because the anchor objects
represent the part of the Web, the application has been in touch, it is often
useful to maintain the anchors throughout the lifetime of the application.
It would actually be most useful if we had persistent anchors so that an
application could build up a higher knowledge about the Web topology.

  <A NAME="Escape">When to Escape and Unescape Addresses</A>

<P>
The <EM>URI escape policy</EM> in libwww is that <B>all</B> URIs created
as <A HREF="../../src/HTAnchor.html">anchors</A> <B>must already have been
escaped</B>. The reason for this is that if URIs are not escaped then the
URI parser is not guaranteed to work as expected. Imagine, for example, that
you have a <TT>":"</TT> in a host name, then you could get something like
this: <TT>http://my:host:8000/</TT> instead of
<TT>http://my%3Ahost:8000/</TT>. &nbsp;Libwww provides
<A HREF="../../src/HTEscape.html">support for escaping and unescaping URIs
using this set of APIs</A>.

<H1>Request Callback functions</H1>

As we have seen in the previous chapters, the core part of the Library knows nothing about how to
access, for example, a HTML document from a remote server. All this depends on what the application
has registered. In many situations there are a number of things to do before a request is actually
sent over the wire. For example we might already have the document in a cache or we might have some
translation of the URL so that we don't go directly to the remote server. The latter case includes
redirection of a request to go through a proxy server or a gateway. Likewise, when a request is
terminated, we might want to keep a log of the request and the result, update history lists
etc. <P>

The Library does provide a large amount of such pre- and post processing modules. However, the exact
amount used by an application depends on the purpose of the application. Simple script-like
applications typically do not need any history mechanism etc. Therefore these modules are not a part
of the core but instead they can be registered as all other preferences. The <A
HREF="../../src/HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> provides functionality for registering a set
of callback functions that can be called <EM>before</EM> and <EM>after</EM> a request has been
executed. Of course, the result of a pre-processing might be that the request does not have to be
executed at all in which case the request can be terminated before the protocol module is called to
execute the request. <P>

<H2>Generic Handling of Callbacks</H2>

The registration of callback functions is handled by the <A HREF="../../src/HTNet.html">
HTNet Manager</A> and it is (of course) based on lists as we have seen so many times before. A
callback function can be added to a list by using the following function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNetCall_add (HTList * list, HTNetCallback * cbf, int status);
</PRE>

The callback function has to be of type <CODE>HTNetCallback</CODE> which is defined as

<PRE>
typedef int HTNetCallback (HTRequest * request, int result);
</PRE>

This means that a callback function is called with the current request object and the result of the
request. Now, if the callback is registered as a <EM>pre</EM> callback then we obviously do not yet
have a result and the functions is called with the code <EM>HT_OK</EM>. However, if it is a
<EM>post</EM> callback function then the result code may take any of the following values:

<DL>
<DT>HT_ERROR
<DD>An error occured
<DT>HT_INTERRUPTED
<DD>The request was interrupted
<DT>HT_LOADED
<DD>The document was loaded
<DT>HT_NO_DATA
<DD>OK, but no data
<DT>HT_RETRY
<DD>Retry request after at a later time
<DT>HT_PERM_REDIRECT
<DD>The request has been permanently redirected and we send back the new URL
<DT>HT_TEMP_REDIRECT
<DD>The request has been temporarily redirected and we send back the new URL
<DT>HT_NO_ACCESS
<DD>The request could not be fulfilled because it didn't contain sufficient credentials
</DL>

When a callback function is registered, it may be registered with a status code for which it is to
be called. This means that there may be different callback functions to handle error situations,
redirections etc. The status code may also take any of the values above, or <EM>HT_ALL</EM> if it is
to be called always. <P>

A callback function may return any code it likes, but <B>IF</B> the return code is different than
<EM>HT_OK</EM>, then the callback loop is stopped. If we are in the <EM>before</EM> loop and a
function returns anything else than <EM>HT_OK</EM> then we immediately jump to the <EM>after</EM>
loop <B>passing</B> the last return code from the <EM>before</EM> loop. <P>

Likewise, a callback function can be removed from a list using the following function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNetCall_delete (HTList * list, HTNetCallback *cbf);
</PRE>

or if you simply want to remove all functions from a list then you can use

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNetCall_deleteAll (HTList * list);
</PRE>

<A NAME="pre"><H2>Pre-Request Callbacks</H2></A>

When a request has been issued there are a number of things that an application might want to do
with the request before it actually goes on the wire, for example to talk to a remote HTTP
server. Examples are checking if the object already is kept in a cache managed by the application,
if the request should be redirected to a proxy or a gateway, or there is some other kind of
translation of the URL taking place. The Library provides a variety of modules that handles many
common place translations such as <EM>redirection of URLs</EM> and <EM>caching</EM>. The full list
of modules are:

<H3>Rule File Management</H3>

An application can be setup by using a rule file, also known as a configuration file. This is for
example the case with the W3C httpd and the W3C Line Mode Browser. The <A
HREF="../../src/HTRules.html">Rules module</A> provides basic support for configuration
file management and the application can use this is desired. The module is not referred to by the
Library. Reading a rule file is implemented as a stream converter so that a rule file can come from
anywhere, even across the network!

<A NAME="proxying"><H3>Proxies and Gateways</H3></A>

Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols, they can in many situations
rely on the support of proxies and gateways to help doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to
carry client requests through a firewall where they can provide services like corporate caching and
other network optimizations. Both Proxy servers and gateways can serve as "protocol translators"
which can convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to an equivalent request in another
protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher. In a later section we will see how to set up the Proxy
servers and gateways using the <A HREF="../../src/HTProxy.html">Proxy module</A>. <P>

As a HTTP request looks different when it is directed to a proxy server than to a origin server, the
HTTP module needs to know whether it is talking to a proxy for this particular request or not. You
can specify in a request object whether a proxy is being used or not by using the following methods:

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setProxing (HTRequest * request, BOOL proxying);
extern BOOL HTRequest_proxying (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H3>Cache Manager</H3>

Caching is a required part of any efficient Internet access applications as it saves bandwidth and
improves access performance significantly in almost all types of accesses.  The Library supports two
different types of cache: The memory cache and the file cache. The two types differ in several ways
which reflects their two main purposes: The memory cache is for short term storage of graphic
objects whereas the file cache is for intermediate term storage of data objects. Often it is
desirable to have both a memory and a file version of a cached document, so the two types do not
exclude each other. The <A HREF="../../src/HTCache.html">HTCache module</A> provides a
basic cache that can be used by an application.

<H3>Register a list of BEFORE Callbacks</H3>

Until now, we have only described how to build a list of callback functions. We will now describe
how to setup a list as either a pre processing set of callback function (the <EM>BEFORE</EM> loop,
or a post processing set (<EM>AFTER</EM> loop). A set of callback functions can be registered to be
called before the request is started by using the following function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNet_setBefore	(HTList * list);
</PRE>

In many cases you know when you register a callback function that this is a function that you always
want to be called when either a request starts up or terminates. In the former case you can simply
register the callback directly using the following function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNetCall_addbefore	(HTNetCallback *cbf, int status);
</PRE>

<H2>Post-Request Callbacks</H2>

When a request is terminated, the application often has to do some action as a result of the request
(and of the result of the request). The Application part of the Library provides two following
modules to handle <EM>logging</EM> and <EM>history management</EM>. You can register a <EM>POST
request handler</EM> in the <A HREF="../../src/HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> as described
in the <A HREF="./">User's Guide</A>. The set of modules provided by the Library is:<P>

<H3>Logging</H3>

Often it is required to log the requests issued to the Library. This can either be the case if the
application is a server or it can also be useful in a client application. The <A
HREF="../../src/HTLog.html">HTLog Module</A> provides a simple logging mechanism which
can be enabled if needed.

<H3>History Management</H3>

Another type of logging is keeping track of which documents a user has visited when browsing along
on the Web. The <A HREF="../../src/HTHist.html">HTHistory module</A> provides a basic set
of functionality to keep track of multiple linear history lists.

<H3>Register a list of AFTER Callbacks</H3>

The registration of a set of callback functions to be called when a request has terminated is
handled in very much the same way:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTNet_setAfter	(HTList * list);
extern BOOL HTNetCall_addBefore (HTNetCallback *cbf, int status);
</PRE>

  Proxy Servers and Gateways
</H1>
<P>
Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols, they
can in many situations rely on the support of proxies and gateways to help
doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to carry client requests through
a firewall where they can provide services like corporate caching and other
network optimizations. Both Proxy servers and gateways can serve as "protocol
translators" which can convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP,
to an equivalent request in another protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher.
In case a proxy server or a gateway is available to the application, it can
therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy server
which then handle the communications with the remote server, for example
using FTP about the document and return it to the application (proxy client)
using HTTP.
<P>
Libwww supports both proxies and gateways through the
<A HREF="../../src/HTProxy.html">HTProxy module</A> and all requests can
be redirected to a proxy or a gateway, even requests on the local file system.
Of course, the Library can also be used in proxy or gateway applications
which in terms can use other proxies or gateways so that a single request
can be passed through a series of intermediate agents.
<P>
There is one main mechanism for registering both proxies and gateways but
there are two different APIs to follow. It is free to the application to
chose which one suits it the best, the functionality provided by the Library
is the same in both cases. The first API is based on a set of registration
functions as we have seen it so often through out this guide. Regardless
of the registration mechanism used, proxy servers are always rated higher
than gateways so if both a proxy server and a gateway is registered for the
same access method, the proxy server will be used.

  Proxy Setup Using Environment Variables
</H2>
<P>
For backwards compatibility with most other Web clients, you can set up proxies
and gateways using environment variables. This is generally discouraged as
environment variables don't work on all platforms and they are only read
at appplication startup. Using the
<A HREF="../../src/HTProxy.html">HTProxy</A> API allow you to change proxies
and gateways dynamically at any time.
<P>
On Unix, you can use a sh script like this to set up proxies and then start
your application:
<PRE>    #!/bin/sh
    http_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/";    export http_proxy
    ftp_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/";     export ftp_proxy
    gopher_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/";  export gopher_proxy
    wais_proxy="http://your.proxy.server:8080/";    export wais_proxy
    no_proxy="cern.ch,ncsa.uiuc.edu,some.host:8080" export no_proxy
    exec webbot $@
</PRE>
<P>
One way to do this under Win32 is to add the following lines to your system
environment:
<PRE>    set http_proxy=http://groucho.marx.edu:1028
    set no_proxy=harpo.marx.edu zeppo.marx.edu chico.marx.edu
</PRE>

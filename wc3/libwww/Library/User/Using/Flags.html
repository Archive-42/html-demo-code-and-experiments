  Trace Messages and Preprocessor Defines
</H1>
<P>
The Library has a huge amount of trace messages that are very useful when
debugging an application. In this section we will have a look at how to use
the trace messages and also what preprocessor defines that can be used to
modify the behavior of the Library.
<H2>
  Trace Messages
</H2>
<P>
The Library has a large set of trace messages that can be enabled in various
ways. They are often an important help to the application programmer in order
to debug an application and this is the reason why they are trated in this
User's Guide.

  Preprocessor Defines
</H2>
<P>
Most of the preprocessor defines in the Library are platform dependent that
are determined as a result of the <A HREF="../../../INSTALL.html">configure
script</A>. However, there are some few defines that on a platform independent
basis can change the default behavior of the Library.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_REENTRANT</CODE> - defined using the
    <A HREF="../../../INSTALL.html">configure script</A>
  <DD>
    This boolean define should be enabled if the reentrant versions ("*_r") of
    the system calls should be used. The name of these system calls are currently
    "*_r", for example <CODE>strtok_r</CODE>. The default value is <EM>OFF</EM>.
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_DIRECT_WAIS</CODE> - defined using the
    <A HREF="../../../INSTALL.html">configure script</A>
  <DD>
    LInking to the <A HREF="../WAIS.html">freeWAIS library</A>. The default value
    is <EM>OFF</EM>.
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_DEFAULT_WAIS_GATEWAY</CODE>
  <DD>
    A constant string value which WAIS gateway to contact if
    <CODE>HT_DIRECT_WAIS</CODE> is not defined and no gateway has been defined
    using environment variables
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_FTP_NO_PORT</CODE>
  <DD>
    The FTP module can handle both <CODE>PASV</CODE> and <CODE>PORT</CODE> when
    requesting a document from a FTP server. If the application is a proxy server
    running on top of a firewall machine then <CODE>PORT</CODE> is normally not
    allowed as a firewall does not accept incoming connections on arbitrary ports.
    This define will disable the use of <CODE>PORT</CODE>. The default value
    is to <EM>use</EM> <CODE>PORT</CODE> if <CODE>PASV</CODE> fails.
  <DT>
    <CODE>WWWLIB_SIG</CODE>
  <DD>
    The Library has a very small set of signal handlers whose action most often
    are simply to ignore the signals. However, due to a bug in the TCP kernel
    on Solaris and other SVR4 platforms returning a SIG_PIPE signal, some kind
    of handling is required on these platforms, and the signal handling is enabled
    by default on these platforms.
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_TMP_ROOT</CODE>
  <DD>
    The default destination for temporary files if no other destination has been
    given by the application. Temporary files include files created for external
    presenters etc. The default value is <CODE>/tmp</CODE> which obviously is
    not suited for large amount of data.
  <DT>
    <CODE>HT_CACHE_ROOT</CODE>
  <DD>
    If the cache is enabled and no cache root directory has been specified then
    use this as the location. The default value is again <CODE>/tmp</CODE>.

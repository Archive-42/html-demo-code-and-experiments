  The Library Core
</H1>
<P>
As mentioned earlier in this guide, the Core of the W3C Sample Code Library
is the set of modules that must be included in every application. However,
the core does not contain any functionality for neither requesting a HTML
document using HTTP, not to parse it or present it to the user. All this
functionality is dynamically registered in the core using an open set of
application modules which we will describe later.
<P>
The Core is basically a set of registration mechanisms that glue together
the application modules, and in the following chapter we will look how to
configure the core to contain exactly the functionality we want for our
application. If you are interested in a more detailed description of the
architecture of the core to see how the glue is designed then please read
the <A HREF="../Architecture/ControlFlow.html">chapter on the model behind
the Core of the Library</A> in the Architecture document. In this section
we will concentrate on the APIs defined by the
<A HREF="../../src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</A> include file and how to use
the Core in a real application.

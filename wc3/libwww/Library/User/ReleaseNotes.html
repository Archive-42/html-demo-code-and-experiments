<h2><a name="5.4.1">Release 5.4.1, October 21, 2005</a></h2>

<p>The first community supported maintenance release contains a number of fixes
to address security, performance, encryption, compile environments, 
internationalization and usability improvments.  It has been a steady year of
modifications.  There is continued interest in porting the library to a variety 
of new platforms, as well as, ongoing support under the existing ones.  
The participants in the mailing list are always the principle driving force for
maintaining the library, however special thanks go to Jose Kahan, Martin Duerst, 
Vic Bancroft, Steinar Bang, Michael Goddard, and Sam Varshavchik for code contributions.</p>

<h2><a name="5.3.111">Release 5.4.0, June 7, 2002</a></h2>

<p>The main feature of this release is the support for the WebDav protocols.
This release also provides bug fixes and small enhancements that have been
commited to CVS since the last release.  Special thanks to Manuele Kirsch
Pinheiro, Richard Atterer, Thurog, Wayne Davison, Peter Stamfest, Zhu
Qun-Ying, Jens Meggers, and the members of the www-lib mailing list for their
contributions .</p>

<p>Some patches sent to the mailing list may have not yet been committed. We need
more volunteers to carry on this work. Documentation also needs a
maintainer.</p>

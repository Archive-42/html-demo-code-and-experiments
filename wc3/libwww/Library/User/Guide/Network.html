<H1>Network Modules</H1>

Network modules handles all the network access including DNS access,
reading and writing to the and from the network etc. Most of these
modules are internal to the Library, however some applications might
use some of them directly.

<H2>TCP Communication</H2>

The functionality of the <A HREF="../../src/HTTCP.html">
HTTCP Module</A> covers several topics but they are all related to
TCP/IP communication. All active and passive connection establishment
from the <A HREF="Protocol.html">Protocol Modules</A> goes through
this module. Furthermore, the module manages a local host cache of
visited hosts so that the Domain Name Server is only consulted when
necessary.<P>

Other topics includes:

<UL>
<LI>I/O status indication (errno etc.)
<LI>Information on remote hosts
<LI>Information on local host (domain name etc.)
<LI>Information on current user (mail address)
</UL>

<H2>Reading Data from a Socket</H2>

The <A HREF="../../src/HTSocket.html">HTSocket Module</A>
controls all the functionality for reading information from a socket
and from the local file system using either a socket or a ANSI C file
descriptor. <P>

The module is currently being transformed into a completely reentrant
version, but the old non-reentrant interface is still needed for some
functions. However, it will be taken out as soon as possible.

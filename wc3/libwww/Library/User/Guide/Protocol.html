<h1>Protocol Modules</h1>
A protocol module is invoked by the <a
href="../../src/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</a> in order to access a
document. Each protocol module is responsible for handling the transmission
of a data object either from the application to a remote server, or vice
verse.

<p>The protocol modules are registered dynamically (using static linking) and
the <a href="../Using/">User's Guide</a> describes how modules can be
registered. Each protocol module is responsible for establishing the
connection to the remote server (or the local file-system) and extract
information using a specific access method. When data arrives from the
network, it is passed on to the format manager.</p>

<p>Most of the protocol modules are now implemented as state machines in
order to support <a href="../Architecture/Threads.html">libwww Threads</a>.
When the client parses a request to the library a <a
href="../../src/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest Structure</a> is filled out and
parsed to a load function in the access manager, for example <a
href="../../src/HTAccess.html"> HTLoadAnchor</a>. HTRequest contains all
information needed by the Library in order to fulfill a request.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="z46" href="../../src/HTFile.html">File access</a></dt>
    <dd>This module provides access to files on a local file system. Due to
      general confusion of the "file://" access scheme in the <a
      href="../../../Addressing/">URL Specifications</a> tries FTP access on
      failure.</dd>
  <dt><a name="z60" href="../../src/HTFTP.html">FTP access</a></dt>
    <dd>This is a complete state based FTP client which is capable of
      communicating with a lot of weird FTP servers. It uses
      <code>PASV</code> as the default method for establishing the data
      connection as <code>PORT</code> does not work if the application is run
      from a firewall machine, as is often the case with <a
      href="../../../Daemon/User/Proxies/Proxies.html">proxy server</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="z45" href="../../src/HTTP.html">HTTP access</a></dt>
    <dd>The <a name="25" href="../../src/HTTP.html">HTTP module</a> handles
      document search and retrieve using the <a
      href="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</a> protocol. See also information on
      the <a href="../Architecture/HTTPFeatures.html"> current
      implementation</a> of the HTTP client. The module is now a complete
      state machine which is a required functionality in the <a
      href="../Architecture/Threads.html">libwww thread model</a>. It uses
      streams for both outgoing and incoming data, the outgoing stream is
      implemented in <a href="../../src/HTTPReq.c"> HTTPReq.c</a> and the
      incoming stream in <a href="../../src/HTTP.c">HTTP.c</a></dd>
  <dt><a href="../../src/HTDAV.html" name="WebDAV">WebDAV access</a></dt>
    <dd id="module">The DAV module implements all WebDAV specific methods and
      headers. WebDAV (RFC 2518) is a set  of extensions  to  the  HTTP 
      protocol,  which allows  users  to collaboratively  edit and  manage 
      web resources. </dd>
  <dt><a name="z40" href="../../src/HTNews.html">News access</a></dt>
    <dd>The NNTP internet news protocol is handled by HTNews which builds a
      hypertext object.
      <p><img border="0" src="../../../Icons/WWW/construction"> This module
      is under reconstruction!</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><a name="z44" href="../../src/HTGopher.html">Gopher access</a></dt>
    <dd>The internet gopher access to menus and flat files (and links to
      telnet nodes, WhoIs servers, CSO Name Server etc.) is handled by <a
      name="26" href="../../src/HTGopher.html">HTGopher Module</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a name="z72" href="../../src/HTTelnet.html">Telnet access</a></dt>
    <dd>This module provides the possibility of running telnet sessions in a
      subshell. It also provides functionality for rlogin and tn3270.</dd>
  <dt><a name="z39" href="../../src/HTWAIS.html">WAIS access</a></dt>
    <dd>WAIS access is not compiled into the Library by default as it
      requires the freeWAIS library. This is easily changed in the platform
      dependent <code>Makefile.include</code> in the
      <pre>        WWW/All/&lt;platform&amp;it;</pre>
      directory. However, if this library is present then the application can
      communicate directly with a WAIS server. Otherwise it must go through a
      <a href="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html"> gateway program</a>.</dd>

<H1>Application Preferences</H1>

These modules handles all the modules that can be registered either
dynamically (using static binding) or statically by the application. 

<H2>Default Initializations</H2>

The <A HREF="../../src/HTInit.html">HTInit module</A>
defines a <A HREF="../../src/HTInit.c">standard set of
initializations</A> where all protocol modules and converters are
setup at startup time of the application in the <A
HREF="../../src/HTLib.html">HTLibInit()</A>. Often
you can take this module and just override it with your own
preferences.

<H2>Handling a Configuration File</H2>

Bindings can also be set up by a rule file that is handled by the <A
HREF="../../src/HTRules.html">Configuration File
Manager</A>. The format of the rule file is yet to be specified and it
does still need some work.

<H2>Bindings to the local file system</H2>

The <A HREF="../../src/HTBind.html">Bind Module</A> makes
bindings between file suffixes and content-type, content-language,
charset etc. As an application this is used when talking to, for
example FTP servers that do not support media types, and servers use
it when performing format negotiation between multiple representations
of a document.

<H2>Registering of Methods</H2>

The idea behind this module is to allow dynamic registration of HTTP
methods, for example PUT, POST, GET etc. and then also allow new
methods to be registered. This has not yet been implemented but the
structure is there :-)

<H2>Registration of Access Schemes</H2>

Access schemes like HTTP, FTP etc. can be registered dynamically
(using static binding) and the <A
HREF="../../src/HTProt.html">HTProt module</A> provides the
support for this.


<H2>Registration of Proxies and Gateways</H2>

The <A HREF="../../src/HTProxy.html">HTProxy Module</A>
provides functionality for registering proxies and gateways
dynamically. This has traditionally been handled by environment
variables, but is now a registration module just like the registration
of access schemes.

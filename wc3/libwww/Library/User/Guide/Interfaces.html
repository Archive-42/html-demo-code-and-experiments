<h1>Library Interfaces</h1>

<p>This is the overall set of interfaces in the W3C Sample Code Library. An
interface can cover multiple related C modules and it is defined by a
<b>WWW*.h</b> include file, for example <a
href="../../src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</a>. On <a
href="../Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows platforms</a>, each interface
corresponds to a DLL with a DLL definition file defining all exported methods
and data objects.</p>

<h2>Core Interfaces</h2>

<p>The core interfaces must be included in all applications. <a
name="dll"></a></p>

<h3>wwwdll.dll</h3>

<p>The wwwdll library is a tiny library that contains a few global variables
like the global <code>WWW_TraceFlag</code>. When Windows loads a DLL, the
exported function and data pointers get "fixed up" in the other modules.
Consequently, what may be a directly addressable piece of data in it's home
library will be a pointer in the other libraries and executables that
dynamically link to it.</p>

</ul>

<h3>wwwutils.dll</h3>

<p>The Utility modules are mostly container modules, dynamic strings and
other stuff that you can't live without when building applications. The
modules are used by the core part of the W3C Sample Code Library but can also
be used by the application. See also the main Library include file called <a
href="../../src/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</a> which contains all converters and
protocol modules known to the Library. You can include this one if the
application is to use all the functionality of the Library.</p>

    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWUtil.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>wwwcore.dll</h3>

<p>This is the basic include file for the core of the W3C Sample Code
Library. Together with the <a href="../../src/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil
module</a> it contains all core specific modules which are required to
compile and build the Library. The core part of the Library is designed as a
set of registration modules with no real functionality in itself. Instead all
the functionality comes when the application registers the modules that
provides a desired functionality, for example accessing HTTP servers or the
local file system. The Library has a special include file called <a
href="../../src/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</a> which a lot of application helper
modules that makes it easier to use the core.</p>

<h2>Stream Interfaces</h2>

    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWStream.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>wwwcache.dll</h3>

<p>The cache contains details of temporary disk files which contain the
contents of remote documents.</p>

    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWCache.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>wwwhtml.dll</h3>

<p>This is the include file for the basic HTML module that can be used
together with the core of the W3C Sample Code Library. It contains all HTML
specific modules which are required to compile and build the HTML DLL. Please
note that as the <a href="../../src/HText.html">HText</a> is <b>not</b>
included in this interface. The reason is that the HText interface only is
declared by the Library but must be defined by the application. Therefore it
can not be part of a DLL but must be included directly in the application.</p>

  <li><a href="../../src/windows/wwwhtml.def">Definition list of exported
    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWHTML.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>wwwdir.dll</h3>

<p>This is the include file for the directory handling modules that can be
used together with the core of the W3C Sample Code Library. It contains all
Directory specific modules which are required to compile and build the
DIRECTORY DLL.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../src/windows/wwwdir.def">Definition list of exported
    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWDir.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>wwwmime.dll</h3>

<p>This is the module for basic RFC822/MIME parsing that can be used together
with the core of the W3C Sample Code Library. It contains all MIME specific
modules which are required to compile and build the MIME DLL.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../src/windows/wwwmime.def">Definition list of exported
    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWMIME.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Application Interfaces</h2>

<h3>wwwapp.dll</h3>

<p>A way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also known as a
configuration file. This is for example the case with the W3C httpd and the
W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic support for configuration
file management and the application can use this is desired. The module is
not referred to by the Library. Reading a rule file is implemented as a
stream converter so that a rule file can come from anywhere, even across the
network!</p>

<p>Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols, they
can in many situations rely on the support of proxies and gateways to help
doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to carry client requests through
a firewall where they can provide services like corporate caching and other
network optimizations. Both Proxy servers and gateways can serve as "protocol
translators" which can convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to
an equivalent request in another protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher.
In case a proxy server or a gateway is available to the application, it can
therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy server
which then handle the communications with the remote server, for example
using FTP about the document and return it to the application (proxy client)
using HTTP.</p>

<p>This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get the
application going. They help you generate the first anchor, also called the
<em>home anchor</em>. It also contains a nice set of default WWW
addresses.</p>

    API</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../src/WWWApp.html">Interface include file</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Initialization Modules</h3>

<p>The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding functionality. It
has hooks for adding protocol modules, like for example HTTP, FTP, and also
for adding streams that can convert from one media type to some other type,
or presenting the result to the user. In the distribution file of the Library
you will find a large set of protocol modules and streams already
implemented. However, in order to use these you need to initialize them. This
can be done by using the methods in the <a
href="../../src/WWWInit.html">WWWInit module</a>. You can modify these
modules as you like to fit your particular needs. The modules in this
interface are <b>not</b> part of any DLL and so must be included directly if
desired.</p>

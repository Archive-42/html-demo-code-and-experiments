<H1>Presentation Modules</H1>

<H2>Generating a Graphic Object</H2>

This document describes the methods provided for presentation a <A
HREF="./#GraphicObject">graphic object</A> to the user. The
implementation in the Library is made for a text oriented browser, so
more advanced GUI clients must overwrite some of these modules. See
more information on which <A HREF="./#Overwrite">modules to
overwrite</A>.

As mentioned in the <A HREF="../Using.html">how to get started
guide</A>, the definition of a graphic object is free for the
application. Some graphic objects work by storing the whole document.
Others work by converting the nested structure into a linear sequence
of styled text for display. <P>

Generally, a new platform has a new implementation of the hypertext
object. A GUI client must overwrite the graphic object modules in the
Library in order to take advantage of a more advanced
user-interface. The graphic object as defined in the Library has two
interfaces, depending on how much of the Library code the client wants
to handle on its own:

<DL>

<DT>SGML Level

<DD>If the client has its own HTML parser then the interface is
between the client HTML parser and the Library SGML parser. The SGML
parser is a general SGML parser which can be setup with a specific DTD
and it feeds the HTML parser with structured data. In this case, you
will be emulating the <A HREF="../../src/HTML.c">HTML
module</A>, and generating a hypertext object from the structured
stream. The actual structured stream definition is in the <A
HREF="../../src/SGML.html">SGML module</A>.

<DT>HTML Level

<DD>If the client wants to use the HTML parser in the Library then
this is the second interface to the Library. The hypertext object is
parsed and the communication with the client is based on a set of
call-back functions in the HTML parser. The call-back functions are
all defined as prototypes in the <A
HREF="../../src/HText.html">HText module</A> but the client
must provide the actual code that defines the presentation method used
for a specific HTML tag. If you wish to maintain the structure of the
SGML file within your object, then the SGML interface will be a better
place to connect your code.

</DL>

You are free to define the structure of the hypertext object declared
in the <A HREF="../../src/HText.html">HText module</A>. You
may want to define your own styles and font definitions. <P>

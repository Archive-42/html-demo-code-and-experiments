  Known Bugs and Patches
</H1>
<P>
As we now have made libwww <A HREF="../../cvs.html">available directly via
CVS</A>, it is much easier to get the <A HREF="../../cvs.html#update">latest
updates and bug fixes</A>. This means that we do not maintain this list very
much anymore. Instead, you should look at the
<A HREF="../ReleaseNotes.html">latest release notes</A> to see if your problem
has been addressed.
<P>
Please report new bugs or bug-fixes to
<A HREF="../../#Forums">&lt;www-lib@w3.org&gt;</A> and describe what caused
the bug to appear. The better diffs you can prepare, that is, if they are
generated <A HREF="../../cvs.html#update">against the latest version in
CVS</A>, the faster they can be incorporated into the code base.

  How to Apply a Patch
</H2>
<P>
The provided patches are relative to the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory in the
distribution tree. In order to apply a patch, do the following in the
<CODE>WWW</CODE> directory:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Download the patch, for example <EM>lib-1.fix</EM>
  <LI>
    Invoke the patch command by typing
    <PRE>	patch &lt; lib-1.fix
</PRE>
  <LI>
    Rebuild the code by following the normal instructions for <B>autoconf</B>
    builds. In many cases you can simply type
    <PRE>	make
</PRE>
    <P>
    from the place where you have run the configure script.
</OL>

  Version 5.0a
</H3>
<P>
Bulding on <B>SunOS</B>: Sun uses the symbol "<CODE>__STDC__</CODE>" in their
headers, not "<CODE>STDC_HEADERS</CODE>" which the configure script is looking
for. This causes a problem compiling
<A HREF="../../src/HTString.c">HTString.c</A> which uses the ANSI definition
of variable arguments. The fix is to define <CODE>STDC_HEADERS</CODE> when
running configure. Depending on your shell, this may look like this
<PRE>	BASH&gt; CFLAGS='-g -Wall -DSTDC_HEADERS' ./configure
	CSH&gt; env CFLAGS='-g -Wall -DSTDC_HEADERS' ./configure

    New Multiple T stream (May 27 1996)

    Event Loop and Timeouts
  <DD>
    The current implementation of the server has a problem with requests that
    timeout. That is, if the remote server is not capable of generating a response
    within the amount of time the server is willing to wait. The server is not
    capable of finding which request object timed out so it has to stop the search
    completely. This is a limitatation of the current implementation of the internal
    <A HREF="../../../Library/src/HTEvent.html">Event loop</A> in the Library.
    It is not a design limitation, but the event loop is currently optimized
    for use by user active applications and not so much "non-user" application.
  <DT>
    DNS lookup
  <DD>
    The current DNS resolution uses the standard <B>getXbyY</B> system calls.
    However, as they traditionally are implemented using blocking sockets, the
    server may block as we only have a single process and a single stack. The
    solution is of course to have a non-blocking DNS resolver library.

  Version 4.0C

<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="lib_4.0C_1.fix">Patch for PUT and POST</A>
  <DD>
    This patch is rather big but it contains some fixes and modifications that
    enables PUT and POST to work reliably. If you download the 4.0C version of
    the distribution then the patch has already been applied. It is basically
    the difference between versions 4.0B and 4.0C. The main set of differences
    are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Automatic redirection and Access authentication has been take n out of the
	HTTP module. Instead the new mechanism with request callback functions are
	used so that the application can register handlers to handle these situations.
	The reason for this change is that not all applications are interested in
	having this functionality performed automatically.
      <LI>
	Authentication handler and redirection handler added to both the Line Mode
	Browser and the Command Line Tool
      <LI>
	Added three possible return codes on which a request callback function can
	be called:
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    HT_PERM_REDIRECT for permanently moved objects
	  <LI>
	    HT_TEMP_REDIRECT for temporarily moved objects
	  <LI>
	    HT_NO_ACCESS for insufficient credentials
	</UL>
      <LI>
	PUT and POST do now work reliably in the Line Mode Browser and the Command
	Line Tool. Both can PUT or POST a document <B>from</B> either a remote HTTP
	server <EM>or</EM> the local file system <B>to</B> a remote HTTP server.
      <LI>
	An important bug-fix in the internal event manager that prevented a socket
	to be registered for multiple events at the same time.
      <LI>
	Cleanup of the POSTWeb management in the file module and the HTTP module
      <LI>
	In addition to progress notification on READ we now support progress notification
	when sending a data object
      <LI>
	Spelling mistake fixed. <EM>preemtive</EM> is changed to <EM>preemptive</EM>
      <LI>
	The W3C Mini Robot has now the ability to stop at a certain depth while
	traversing the Web.

  Library 4.0
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="lib_4.0_1.fix">SGML fix from Maciej Puzio for better error
    handling</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="lib_4.0_bug_3.html">Generating DLLs under Windows using Borland
    compilers</A>
  <LI>
    Bug in management of <A HREF="lib_4.0_bug_2.html"><EM>select()</EM> timeout
    handler</A>
  <LI>
    Bug in <A HREF="lib_4.0_bug_1.html"><EM>no-proxy</EM> directive</A>
  <LI>
    HTML Machinery is still missing a great deal. However this part is now isolated
    into the SGML-HTML-HText stream pipe and will be replaced by a new parser
    as soon as possible in connection with the development of Arena.
  <LI>
    Directory listings do not work completely on Windows NT
</UL>
<H3>
  Library 3.1
</H3>
<DL>
  <DT>
    Bug in time stamp on files in FTP directory listings
  <DD>
    The Library supports "long" directory listings for FTP Unix, VMS and Windows
    NT servers with file type, size, time and date etc. However, the time stamp
    is wrong by one hour for files created when daylight saving time is enabled.
    The reason is that the FTP module in the Library doesn't know the time-zone
    of the remote FTP server and hence doesn't know when DSR is enabled or disabled.
    This is fixed in the next version
  <DT>
    <A HREF="lib_3.1_1.fix">Problem with nested HTML tags in the HTML parser</A>
  <DD>
    A bug which makes the HTML parser crash if is gets more than 20 nested HTML
    tags. Thanks to Robert M. Fleischman for pointing this out!
</DL>
<H3>
  Library 3.0
</H3>
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="lib_3.0_1.fix">Problems with redirection</A>
  <DD>
    Until now all HTTP servers have sent back a small HTML document with a
    redirection message going:
    <PRE>
	If you can see this message then your browser
	does not support automatic redirection.
</PRE>
    <P>
    However, new severs like Netscape and other servers don't send this and hence
    no stream should be set up. This confuses the Library and it dumps core.

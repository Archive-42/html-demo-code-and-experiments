<h1>Libwww Survey</h1>
<hr>

<p>The survey is now closed. I haven't found time to compile the results. Help
is welcome. I hope to do so in January. You can consult the survey answers in
the on-line archive. --<em>jose</em></p>
<hr>

<p>We're conducting a survey so that we can get a better idea of what are
libwww's limitations,  where new developments/effort should be invested, and
how many people are actively using it.</p>

<p>To participate, please download the <a href="survey.txt">survey text
form</a>, answer it, and mail it to <a
href="mailto:www-lib-survey@w3.org">www-lib-survey@w3.org</a>.<br>
You can follow the answers to the survey on the dedicated <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib-survey">mailing list
archive</a>.</p>

<p>The survey is open from September 22 up to October 6, 2000. The results
will be made available on this page, and will also be posted to the regular
libwww mailing list.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments and views!</p>

<p>N.B. This survey doesn't mean that W3C plans to invest more resources on
libwww or its further development. We expect this effort to come from the open
source community.</p>

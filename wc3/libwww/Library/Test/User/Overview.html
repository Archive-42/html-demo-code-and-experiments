  Core Function Testing (beta version)
</H1>
<P>
To aid the development and progress of the
<A HREF="../../User/Overview.html">World Wide Web Sample Code Library</A>,
we have added tests to the library. Largely aiding the developers into showing
which functions are working and when in fixing the library, which functions
break.
<P>
Documentation on this testing is a little sparse and inadequate. Improvements
will be made especially concerning documentation.
<P>
Ultimately, core function testing just amounts to writing lots of glue code
and scripting. Large chunks are pretty repetitive, while others add lots
of variance in patterns. What it amounts to is trying to capture all the
possible failures in the glue code, such that the scripting language will
not crash while being run in dejagnu. Unfortunately, I haven't been too good
at capturing everything, but it suffices to show that the functions work.
<P>
Xing is now here working on the glue code to solidify the functionality between
Tcl and C, so that quick implementations can be done using Tk and such. That
will also result in a nice testing interface. Currently, my work has caught
typos, small bugs and such, with the largest noticable flaw in the core library
being in the parsing. The parsing functions do not hold to rfc1808.
<P>
This code is mostly here to show you that the library is functional, and
does what it says. It is not a very robust testing method, as it can crash
easily with improper setup. Also, a lot of this testing is black box testing...we
need to peer into a lot of the data structures to test some of the results.
However, I haven't got around to creating functions to output the elements
of data structures like HTList for example.
<P>
Also, a lot of functions that have unique data structures (i.e. are the only
function or so to use it.) haven't been implemented.
<P>
I've tried to make the glue code as complete as possible for the modules
listed. A couple modules were only done simply to get at creation controls
to pass them along to other functions.

<UL>
  <LI>
    Parsing Errors. These errors are attributed to the library itself. The code
    does not support the new rfc concerning relative urls and has trouble simplifying
    directory structures.
  <LI>
    Parsing errors due to the method in which tcl handles strings. Have not yet
    found work around.
  <LI>
    Avoid HTCleanTelnetString tests. They have characters causing havoc to dejagnu.
    Either test individual modules or remove it.
  <LI>
    Showing enumerations: current solution is to output the octal value.
  <LI>
    functions using (void *) are not currently fully functional.
  <LI>
    Escape characters are causing problems with tcl/expect. When trying to run
    HTCleanTelnetString tests, it eventually fails the rest as the program apparently
    is spewing a specific escape character.
  <LI>
    extern void HTRequest_setPostCallback (HTRequest * request, HTPostCallback
    * cbf) not implemented
  <LI>
    extern HTPostCallback * HTRequest_postCallback (HTRequest * request) not
    implemented
  <LI>
    Nagging error with processing HTRequest.exp. Apparently the header functions
    (i.e. gnhd, rqhd, etc.) are crashing wwwtest. I have yet to isolate the cause.

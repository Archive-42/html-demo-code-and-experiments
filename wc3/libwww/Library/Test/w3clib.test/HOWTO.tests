The tests are set up pretty simply. Adding more to the suite is easy,
unfortunately, since I'm not a great programmer, I can't give much
freedom in the format of the test files.... as long as you follow the
examples you're pretty safe. Just some hints:

For those that have spaces within the text use quotes. 

Avoid the dollar sign with text directly following it.

Also, the format requires there to be a space between the
descriptive tag (i.e. access: ) and the data.

Between every test set, use the delimiting * barrier. It should be 11.

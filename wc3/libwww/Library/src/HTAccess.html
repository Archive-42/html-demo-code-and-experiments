<P>
This module is the application interface module to the
<A HREF="HTReq.html">Request class</A>. It contains a lot of methods for
loading URIs and also for uploading URIs using <CODE>PUT</CODE> or
<CODE>POST</CODE>, for example. You can use the Request class directly but
this module makes it easier to use by providing a lot of small request functions
using the Request class in different ways. It contains help functions for
accessing documents and for uploading documents to a remote server.
<P>
This module contains functions for handling all HTTP/1.1 methods:
<DL>
  <DT>
    GET Requests
  <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI>
	<A HREF="#Load">Various GET requests including specialized functions like

    </UL>
</DL>
<P>
Furthermore, it contains a <A HREF="#serve">few access methods for handling
incoming requests</A> - in orther words acting as a server. Although libwww
is primarily for clients, it is in fact symmetric in that it can handle both
client requests and server requests.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTAccess.c">HTAccess.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

  <A NAME="Load">Load a Document (Method = GET)</A>
</H2>
<P>
URIs can be accesses using a character string, for example
"<CODE>http://www.w3.org</CODE>" or it can be accessed by using the libwww
representation of a URI called an <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A>.
Note that we call all objects accessible through URIs for <I>documents</I>
- this is a notion we have inherited from the hypertext world.
<H3>
  Load a Document from Absolute URI
</H3>
<P>
Request a document referencd by an <I>absolute</I> URI. The output from the
request is passed to the <A HREF="HTFormat.html">Stream Pipe Manager</A>
that figures out where to pump the data. This can for example be to the display
or to a local file depending on the set of
<A HREF="HTFormat.html#type">converters</A> registered by the application.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTLoadAbsolute (const char * url, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Load a Document from Relative URI
</H3>
<P>
Request a document referenced by a <I>relative</I> URI. The relative URI
is made absolute by resolving it relative to the address of the '<I>base</I>'
anchor.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTLoadRelative (const char * 	relative,
			    HTParentAnchor *	base,
			    HTRequest *		request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Load a Document into Memory
</H3>
<P>
Request a document referred to by the URI and load it into a
<A HREF="HTChunk.html">HTChunk object</A>. A <A HREF="HTChunk.html">chunk
object</A> is a dynamic string so in the end you will have a single memory
buffer containing the document. The chunk must be freed by the caller.
<PRE>extern HTChunk * HTLoadToChunk (const char * url, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Load a Document and Save as a Local File
</H3>
<P>
This function loads a URI and saves the contents in the specifed file. The
file should not &nbsp;be open, as the load function both opens and closes
the file. If the file already exists then it asks the user whether the file
should be overwritten or not. the contents is saved <I>ASIS</I> - that is
- we do not touch the contents of the file!
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadToFile (const char * url, HTRequest * request,
			  const char * filename);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Load a Document and put the Contents into a Stream
</H3>
<P>
Request a document referenced by an absolute URI and sending the data down
a stream. This stream can be anny stream you like, for eample one from the
<A HREF="WWWStream.html">Stream Interface</A>.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadToStream (const char * url, HTStream * output,
			    HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Load a Document using an Anchor
</H3>
<P>
Here the URI is represented by an <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A>.
You can get an anchor object representing a URI by passing the URI to the
appropriate method in the <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor class</A>.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTLoadAnchor (HTAnchor * anchor, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Load a Document into Memory using an Anchor
</H3>
<P>
This is the same as <CODE>HTLoadToChunk</CODE> but instead of passing a URI
string you pass an <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">HTAnchor object</A>. Internally,
all URIs are represented as anchors which contains all the information we
have about the resource. The chunk must be freed by the caller.
<PRE>extern HTChunk * HTLoadAnchorToChunk (HTAnchor * anchor, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Recursively Request a Document using Anchors
</H3>
<P>
Same as <CODE>HTLoadAnchor()</CODE> but the information in the
<A HREF="HTReq.html#Error">error stack</A> in the <A HREF="HTReq.html">request
object</A> is kept, so that any error messages in one. This function is almost
identical to <CODE>HTLoadAnchor</CODE>, but it doesn't clear the error stack
so that the information in there is kept.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTLoadAnchorRecursive (HTAnchor * anchor, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Load Special Documents
</H2>
<P>
We also have a set of functions for loading special files like rules files
which also are referenced by a URI but which do have to be treated specially.
<H3>
  Load a Rule File
</H3>
<P>
Rule files can be loaded just like any other URI but you can also just use
these functions which do all the work for you: they load a rule find with
the URI specified and add the set of rules to the existing set.
<P>
They come in two flavours - one that asks the user whether it is OK to add
the rules and one that does it automatically without asking. As the app would
have to call this method explicitly, it may have other ways of protecting
the user.
<P>
Both functions use <A HREF="HTReq.html#preemptive">preemptive requests</A>
so that everything else stops in the meantime.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadRules (const char * url);
extern BOOL HTLoadRulesAutomatically (const char * url);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Search">Search a Document (Method = GET)</A>
</H2>
<P>
The search methods all use <CODE>GET</CODE> as the method in the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/">HTTP request</A>. The functions take
the keywords and encode them according to
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1866.txt">RFC
1866 (Hypertext Markup language)</A>. That is, the query part is separated
from the rest of the URI by a "?".
<P>
The keywords are passed to the function as a <A HREF="HTChunk.html">Chunk
Object</A> and each keyword <B>must</B> be separated by a space ' '. This
will then be converted into a '+' before added to the URI.
<H3>
  Search a Document from Absolute URI
</H3>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTSearchAbsolute (HTChunk *		keywords,
			      const char *	base,
			      HTRequest *	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Search a Document from Relative URI
</H3>
<P>
Search a document referenced by a <I>relative</I> URI. The relative URI is
made absolute by resolving it relative to the address of the '<I>base</I>'
anchor.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTSearchRelative (HTChunk *		keywords,
			      const char * 	relative,
			      HTParentAnchor *	base,
			      HTRequest *	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Search a Document using an Anchor
</H3>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTSearchAnchor (HTChunk *		keywords,
			    HTAnchor *		anchor,
			    HTRequest * 	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Search a Document using an Anchor Using a String
</H3>
<P>
This works exactly as the <CODE>HTSearchAnchor()</CODE> function but takes
a C string instead of a <A HREF="HTChunk.html">chunk object</A>.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTSearchString (const char *	keywords,
			    HTAnchor *		anchor,
			    HTRequest * 	request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="getforms">Submit Forms Using GET Method</A>
</H2>
<P>
Formdata can be sent to an HTTP server in two ways - it can either use a
<CODE>GET</CODE> method or it can use a <CODE>POST</CODE> method. The difference
is whether the request "has side effects" or not. For example, if you are
ordering a pizza then the (hopefully positive) sideeffect is that you actually
get one delivered. However, if you are issuing search data - for example
to Alta Vista, then there is no sideeffect. In the former example you would
use the <CODE>GET</CODE> form and in the latter you would use the
<CODE>POST</CODE> form.
<H3>
  Submit Form from Absolute URI using GET
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata using GET to the address indicated as the "base" which must
be an absolute URI. The list of form data must be given as an
<A HREF="HTAssoc.html">association list</A> where the name is the field name
and the value is the value of the field.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTGetFormAbsolute (HTAssocList *	formdata,
			       const char *	base,
			       HTRequest *	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Submit Form from Relative URI using GET
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata using GET to the address indicated relative to the address
of the base anchor. The list of form data must be given as an
<A HREF="HTAssoc.html">association list</A> where the name is the field name
and the value is the value of the field.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTGetFormRelative (HTAssocList * 	formdata,
			       const char * 	relative,
			       HTParentAnchor *	base,
			       HTRequest *	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Send a Form using an Anchor and the GET Method
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata using GET to the address indicated of the anchor. The list
of form data must be given as an <A HREF="HTAssoc.html">association list</A>
where the name is the field name and the value is the value of the field.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTGetFormAnchor (HTAssocList *	formdata,
			     HTAnchor *		anchor,
			     HTRequest * 	request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="PostForms">Submit Forms Using POST Method</A>
</H2>
<P>
The data in a <CODE>POST</CODE> form is sent as the body part of the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/">HTTP</A> message whereas a
<CODE>GET</CODE> form wraps it all up into the URI. In order to be able to
use the <CODE>POST</CODE> data object at a later point in time, we create
a new anchor on the fly. This anchor has a URI file location which points
into the temporary area given by the <A HREF="HTUser.html">User Profile
Object</A>. That is - you can actually save the anchor using a
<CODE>PUT</CODE> request and then be able to retrive the form data at a later
point in time. Even though this may seem "ambitious" for posting form data,
it is really just a special example of sending any kind of data to a remote
server. All <CODE>POST</CODE> form functions return the new anchor or
<CODE>NULL</CODE> if they fail.
<H3>
  Submit Form from Absolute URI using POST
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata using POST to the address indicated as the "base" which must
be an absolute URI. The list of form data must be given as an
<A HREF="HTAssoc.html">association list</A> where the name is the field name
and the value is the value of the field.
<PRE>
extern HTParentAnchor * HTPostFormAbsolute (HTAssocList *	formdata,
					    const char *	base,
					    HTRequest *	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Submit Form from a Relative URI using GET
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata using POST to the address indicated relative to the address
of the base anchor. The list of form data must be given as an association
list where the name is the field name and the value is the value of the field.
<PRE>
extern HTParentAnchor * HTPostFormRelative (HTAssocList * 	formdata,
					    const char * 	relative,
					    HTParentAnchor *	base,
					    HTRequest *		request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Submit Form using an Anchor and the POST Method
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata using POST to the address indicated of the anchor. The list
of form data must be given as an <A HREF="HTAssoc.html">association list</A>
where the name is the field name and the value is the value of the field.
<PRE>
extern HTParentAnchor * HTPostFormAnchor (HTAssocList *	formdata,
					  HTAnchor *	anchor,
					  HTRequest * 	request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Submit Form and Save the Result in a Memory Buffer
</H3>
<P>
Submit formdata to the address referred to by the
<A HREF="HTAnchor.html">HTAnchor object</A> and load the result of the POST
into a <A HREF="HTChunk.html">HTChunk object</A>. A
<A HREF="HTChunk.html">chunk object</A> is a dynamic memory buffer so in
the end you will have a single memory buffer containing the document. The
chunk must be freed by the caller.
<PRE>
extern HTChunk * HTPostFormAnchorToChunk (HTAssocList * formdata,
                                          HTAnchor *    anchor,
                                          HTRequest *   request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Head">Get Metainformation about a Document (Method = HEAD)</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you are not interested in the document itself but only in the
<I>metainformation</I> that <I>describes</I> the document then you should
use the <CODE>HEAD</CODE> method in your request.
<H3>
  Get Metainformation about a Document from Absolute URI
</H3>
<P>
Request metainfomration about a document referencd by an <I>absolute</I>
URI.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTHeadAbsolute (const char * url, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Get Metainformation about a Document from Relative URI
</H3>
<P>

<H3>
  Get Metainformation about a Document using an Anchor
</H3>
<P>
Here the URI is represented by an <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A>.
You can get an anchor object representing a URI by passing the URI to the
approproiate method in the <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor class</A>.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTHeadAnchor (HTAnchor * anchor, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Delete">Delete a Document (Method = DELETE)</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you want to delete a document (or make the document inaccessible for future
references) then you can use the <CODE>DELETE</CODE> method in your request.
<H3>
  Delete a Document from Absolute URI
</H3>
<P>
Request metainfomration about a document referencd by an <I>absolute</I>
URI.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTDeleteAbsolute (const char * url, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Delete a Document from Relative URI

<H2>
  <A NAME="SaveASIS">Save a Document ASIS From Memory (Method = PUT)</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you already have a document in memory and it is associated with an
<A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A> then you can PUT this document
to a remote server using the following methods. Other information that you
can set in the anchor is metadata like the media type, the document length,
the language, or any other information that you want to associate with the
document to be uploaded.
<P>
This set of functions takes the document <B>ASIS</B> - that it the
<I>exact</I> content of the document associated with this anchor will be
sent to the remote server. If your anchor represents a structured content
and the document itself is a parse tree, for example, then you can use the
<A HREF="#SaveStructured">structured PUT functions</A>.
<P>
If your application is an editor, then you may want to create a new anchor
on the fly for temporary backups on local disk before you save it to a remote
server. An easy way to get a new anchor with a local file URI is to use the
<A HREF="HTHome.html#temp">HTTmpAnchor</A> function which is part of the
<A HREF="WWWApp.html">WWWApp interface</A>.
<H3>
  Save a Document ASIS from Memory Using Absolute URI (PUT)
</H3>
<P>
The source is an anchor with the contents already in memory and the destination
is an absolute URI.
<PRE>

<H2>
  <A NAME="SaveStructured">Save a Structured Document (Using PUT)</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you want to save a document from memory but it contains structured information
(for example, it is in the form of a parse tree) then you can use this interface.
The only difference from above is that the caller must provide the function
that provides data while sending it accross the network - we can't just take
it as a block. You can for example have a look at the
<CODE>HTEntity_callback</CODE> function which is used in the
<A HREF="#SaveASIS"><B>ASIS</B> interface</A> if you want to write your own
data feeding method.
<H3>
  Save a Structured Document from Memory to Absolute URI (PUT)

</H2>
<P>
If the content of the document associated with the anchor is <B>NOT</B> in
memory then you can use this interface. These methods make two requests:
first they go out and get the source which can be on an FTP server, on local
disk, on another HTTP server etc. and then they PUT this document ASIS to
the destination HTTP server.

  <A NAME="PostASIS">Post a Document from Memory ASIS (Method = POST)</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you already have a document in memory and it is associated with an

<H2>
  <A NAME="OPTIONS">Get Available Options for a Document (Method = OPTIONS)</A>
</H2>
<P>
If you want to get information about a document then you can use the the
<CODE>OPTIONS</CODE> method in your request. The <CODE>OPTIONS</CODE> method
represents a request for information about the communication options available
on the request/response chain identified by the <CODE>Request-URI</CODE>.
This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements
associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying
a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.
<P>
A speciality about the <CODE>OPTIONS</CODE> method is that the client can
issue a request with no pathinfo at all but only with a "<CODE>*</CODE>".
That is, the request line can look like this "<CODE>OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1</CODE>".
This means that we request information about the server as a whole and not
only about a single URI. You can get this effect by using a URI containing
the hostname alone with <B>NO</B> extra slash at the end, for example
<CODE>http://www.w3.org</CODE>, <CODE>http://www.cern.ch</CODE>.

  <A NAME="TRACE">Get Trace Loop back Information for a Document (Method =
  TRACE)</A>
</H2>
<P>
The TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop-back
of the request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect
the message received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK)
response. The final recipient is either the origin server or the first proxy
or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request (see
section 14.31). A TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity.
<P>
TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other end of
the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic information.
The value of the Via header field (section 14.44) is of particular interest,
since it acts as a trace of the request chain. Use of the Max-Forwards header
field allows the client to limit the length of the request chain, which is
useful for testing a chain of proxies forwarding messages in an infinite
loop.
<P>
If successful, the response SHOULD contain the entire request message in
the entity-body, with a Content-Type of <CODE>"message/http"</CODE>. Responses
to this method MUST NOT be cached.

  <A NAME="serve">Serve a Request</A>
</H2>
<P>
Although libwww is primarily for clients, it is in fact symmetric in that
it can handle both client requests and server requests. The way this is handled
is that each <A HREF="HTProt.html">protocol</A> is registered with both a
client handler and a server handler - depending on which type of request
you use, one of them is called. Note that in order to be able to serve any
document, there actually have to be a server handler. However, libwww only
comes with a <A HREF="HTSocket.html">raw socket loader</A> which isn't much
of a server. There is an <A HREF="HTTPServ.html">attempt of an HTTP server</A>
but it is not complete
<P>
The protocol handler used to serve the request is determined by the URI -
just as for client side requests. That is, libwww can in fact simultaneously
be the server for multiple protocols if you really want to. Examples of URIs
that you can use are <TT>noop://localhost:8888</TT> which means that libwww
starts listening on port 8888 (see the <A HREF="../Examples/listen.c">listen
example</A> for details). Other examples are <TT>http://localhost:7777</TT>
which means that it listens for HTTP on port 7777. Again, there is no HTTP
server in libwww - this is just an example.

  Save a URI To Multiple Destinations - Not supported!!!
</H2>
<P>
<STRONG>Note: This is no longer supported</STRONG>
<P>
These are the generic versions of the <CODE>PUT</CODE> and <CODE>POST</CODE>
functions. They can be used to send documents to multiple destinations
simultanously using the PostWeb model.
<H3>
  Copy an anchor - not supported
</H3>
<P>
Fetch the URI from either local file store <B>or</B> from a remote HTTP server
and send it using either PUT or POST to the remote destination using HTTP.
The caller can decide the exact method used and which HTTP header fields
to transmit by setting the user fields in the request structure. If posting
to NNTP then we can't dispatch at this level but must pass the source anchor
to the news module that then takes all the refs to NNTP and puts into the
"newsgroups" header Returns YES if request accepted, else NO
<PRE>extern BOOL HTCopyAnchor (HTAnchor * src_anchor, HTRequest * main_req);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Upload an Anchor - not supported
</H3>
<P>
This function can be used to send data along with a request to a remote server.
It can for example be used to POST form data to a remote HTTP server - or
it can be used to post a newsletter to a NNTP server. In either case, you
pass a callback function which the request calls when the remote destination
is ready to accept data. In this callback you get the current request object
and a stream into where you can write data. It is very important that you
return the value returned by this stream to the Library so that it knows
what to do next. The reason is that the outgoing stream might block or an
error may occur and in that case the Library must know about it. If you do
not want to handle the stream interface yourself then you can use the
<CODE>HTUpload_callback</CODE> which is declared below. The source anchor
represents the data object in memory and it points to the destination anchor
by using the <A HREF="../User/Architecture/PostWeb.html">POSTWeb method</A>.
The source anchor contains metainformation about the data object in memory
and the destination anchor represents the reponse from the remote server.
Returns YES if request accepted, else NO

			    HTRequest * 	request,
			    HTPostCallback *	callback);

  POST Callback Handler - not supported
</H3>
<P>
Is you do not want to handle the stream interface on your own, you can use
this "middleman" function which does the actual writing to the target stream
for the anchor upload and also handles the return value from the stream.
Now, your application is called via the callback function that you may associate
with a request object. You indicate when you have sent all the data you want
by returning HT_LOADED from the callback.

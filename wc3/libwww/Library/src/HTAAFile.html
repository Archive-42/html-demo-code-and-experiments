<H1>File Routines For Access Authorization Package</H1>

This module implements the routines used for accessing (and parsing)
the files used in the access authorization:
<UL>
<LI>password file
<LI>group file
<LI>access control list (ACL) file
</UL>

<H2>Naming conventions</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Record<DD>is an entire line in file.
<DT>Field<DD>is an entity separated by colons and/or by end-of-line.
<DT>List<DD>is a field in which there are items separated by commas.
</DL>
<P>

<H2>Record-oriented Read Routines</H2>

Password, group and ACL are internally read in by the following
functions:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>HTAAFile_nextRec()</CODE><DD> skips to the beginning of the
next record (must be called even after the last field of a record is
read to proceed to the next record).
<DT><CODE>HTAAFile_readField()</CODE><DD> reads a field (separated by
colons).
<DT><CODE>HTAAFile_readList()</CODE><DD> reads a field containing a
comma-separated list of items.
</DL>

<P>
This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types from
magic words. The stream is a one that reads first a chunk of stuff, tries
to figure out the format, and calls <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is
a kind of lazy-evaluation of <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>.
<P>
This could be extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible file formats
in the world, if someone only had time to do it.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTGuess.c">HTGuess.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

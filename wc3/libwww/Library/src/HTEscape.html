  Escape and Unescape Illegal Characters in URIs

<P>
URLs are written only with the graphic printable characters of the US-ASCII
coded character set. All other characters must be escaped before they can
be used in URLs. This module defines the methods required for escaping and
unescaping the URLs. Internally in the Library, all URLs are escaped so that
we never see illegal characters in the URL handled by the Library. We only
unescape the URLs when we have to, for example while taking to the local
file system etc.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTEscape.c">HTEscape.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

  Encode Unacceptable Characters using %xy
</H2>
<P>
This function takes a string containing any sequence of ASCII characters,
and returns a malloced string containing the same infromation but with all
"unacceptable" characters represented in the form <CODE>%xy</CODE> where
<CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> are two hex digits.

  Decode %xy Escaped Characters
</H2>
<P>
This function takes a pointer to a string in which character smay have been
encoded in <CODE>%xy</CODE> form, where <CODE>xy</CODE> is the acsii hex
code for character 16x+y. The string is converted in place, as it will never
grow.

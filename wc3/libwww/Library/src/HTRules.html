<P>
The W3C Library provides this module for handling configuration files (a.k.a.
rule files). Rule files can be used to initialize as much as the application
desires including setting up new protocol modules etc. Also the rules file
do not have to be a fil - it can be a database or any other way of storage
information. This implementation is not used by the Library at all and is
part of the <A HREF="WWWApp.html">Application interface</A>.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTRules.c">HTRules.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

  Parse a Rule File
</H2>
<P>
Parsing a whole rule file is done using a converter stream. This means
that a rule file can come from anywhere, even accross the network. We
have defined a special content type for rule files called
<CODE>WWW_RULES</CODE> in <A HREF="HTFormat.html">HTFormat</A> and
made a file suffix binding for all files ending in
<CODE>".conf"</CODE> in the <A HREF="HTBInit.html">default
initialization</A> of the <A HREF="HTBind.html">file suffix bindings
module</A>.
<P>
The rule file parser comes in two variants: one that asks the user and
one that doesn't. Needless to say that you have to be carefull with
the latter one. You can also define <CODE>HT_AUTOMATIC_RULES</CODE>
when <A HREF="../../INSTALL.html">compiling libwww</A> to determine
whether it is OK to parse a rule file without asking the user.

<H2>
  Parse a single line from a Rule File
</H2>
<P>
This routine may be used for loading configuration information from sources
other than the rule file, for example INI files for X resources.
<CODE>config</CODE> is a string in the syntax of a rule file line.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRule_parseLine (HTList * list, const char * config);

<H2>
  Add a Rule to the List
</H2>
<P>
This function adds a rule to the list of rules. The <CODE>pattern</CODE>
is a 0-terminated string containing a single "*". <CODE>equiv</CODE> points
to the equivalent string with * for the place where the text matched by *
goes.
<PRE>
typedef struct _HTRule HTRule;

typedef enum _HTRuleOp {
    HT_Invalid, 
    HT_Map, 
    HT_Pass, 
    HT_Fail,
    HT_DefProt,
    HT_Protect,
    HT_Exec,
    HT_Redirect,
    HT_UseProxy
} HTRuleOp;

extern BOOL HTRule_add (HTList * list, HTRuleOp op,
			const char * pattern, const char * replace);

  Delete all Registered Rules
</H2>
<P>
This function clears all rules registered
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRule_deleteAll (HTList *list);

<H2>
  Global Rules
</H2>
<P>
Rules are handled as list as everything else that has to do with preferences.
We provide two functions for getting and setting the global rules:
<PRE>
extern HTList * HTRule_global(void);
extern BOOL HTRule_setGlobal (HTList * list);
extern BOOL HTRule_addGlobal (HTRuleOp op, const char * pattern, const char * replace);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Translate by rules
</H2>
<P>
This function walks through the list of rules and translates the reference
when matches are found. The list is traversed in order starting from the
head of the list. It returns the address of the equivalent string allocated
from the heap which the CALLER MUST FREE. If no translation occured, then
it is a copy of the original.
<PRE>
extern char * HTRule_translate (HTList * list, const char * token,
				BOOL ignore_case);

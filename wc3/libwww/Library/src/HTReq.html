</PRE>
<P>
Libwww is based on a request/response paradigm and the Request class defines
"<I>an operation to be performed on a URL</I>". The request object is the
main entry point for an application to issue a request to the Library - all
operations on a URL <I>must</I> use a Request object. The request object
is application independent in that both servers and clients use the same
Request class. Examples of requests passed to the Library are a client
application issuing a <B>GET</B> request on a HTTP URL, or a server issuing
a load on a local file URL. The only difference is that the client gets the
input from a user whereas the server gets the input via the network.
<P>
A request object is created with a default set of parameters which are applicable
for many URL requests but the class defines a huge set of methods that an
be used to customize a request for a particular purpose. Example of things
that you can define is natural language, media types, what RFC 822 headers
to use, whether the request should be refreshed from cache etc. Scroll down
and see the set of parameters you can tune.
<P>
A request object is registered in the library by issuing an operation on
a URL - for example <B>PUT</B>, <B>POST</B>, or <B>DELETE</B>. You can find
many higher level "request issuing functions" in the
<A HREF="HTAccess.html">Access module</A> - the methods defined by the Request
class itself are very low level but can of course be used directly if needed.
<P>
Whereas the lifetime of the URL (in form of an anchor) often is very long
(for example as long as the application is running), the lifetime of a request
is limited to the time it takes to service the request. The core does not
automatically delete any request object created by the application - it is
for the application to do. In many cases a request object can be deleted
when any of the <A HREF="HTNet.html#callout">termination callback functions</A>
are called but the application may keep request objects around longer than
that
<P>
The Library can accept an unlimited number of simultaneous requests passed
by the application. One of the main functions of the Library core is to handle
any number of ongoing requests in an intelligent manner by limiting the number
of active request to the fit the available resources as defined by the
application. This is described in more detail in the <A HREF="HTNet.html">HTNet
module</A>.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTReqMan.c">HTReqMan.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

  <A NAME="Creation">Creation and Deletion Methods</A>
</H2>
<P>
The request object is intended to live as long as the request is still active,
but can be deleted as soon as it has terminated, for example in one of the
request termination callback functions as described in the
<A HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A>. Only the anchor object stays around
after the request itself is terminated.
<H3>
  Create new Object
</H3>
<P>
Creates a new request object with a default set of options -- in most cases
it will need some information added which can be done using the methods in
this module, but it will work as is for a simple request.
<PRE>
extern HTRequest * HTRequest_new (void);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Clear a Request Object
</H3>
<P>
Clears all protocol specific information so that the request object can be
used for another request. It should be used with care as application specific
information is <B>not</B> re-initialized. Returns YES if OK, else NO.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_clear (HTRequest * me);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Create a duplicate
</H3>
<P>
Creates a new HTRequest object as a duplicate of the src request. Returns
YES if OK, else NO
<PRE>
extern HTRequest * HTRequest_dup (HTRequest * src);
</PRE>
<H4>
  Create a duplicate for Internal use
</H4>
<P>
Creates a new HTRequest object as a duplicate of the src request. The difference
to the HTRequest_dup function is that we don't copy the error_stack and other
information that the application keeps in its copy of the request object.
Otherwise it will be freed multiple times. Returns YES if OK, else NO
<PRE>
extern HTRequest * HTRequest_dupInternal (HTRequest * src);

extern BOOL HTRequest_setInternal (HTRequest * request, BOOL mode);
extern BOOL HTRequest_internal (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Delete Object
</H3>
<P>
This function deletes the object and cleans up the memory.
<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_delete (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Issuing">Issuing a Request</A>
</H2>
<P>
These are the "<I>basic request methods</I>" provided directly by the Request
class. This is a very low level API as the caller must have set up the request
object before passing it to libwww. There are two versions: one for issuing
client requests and one for issuing server requests. You will probably most
often use the client version, but, in fact, libwww can also deal with incoming
connections. You can find many higher level issuing functions in the
<A HREF="HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A>. If you like, you can of course
use this directly!
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoad (HTRequest * request, BOOL recursive);
extern BOOL HTServe(HTRequest * request, BOOL recursive);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Killing">Killing a Request</A>
</H2>
<P>
This function kills this particular request, see <A HREF="HTNet.html">HTNet
module</A> for a function that kills them all. If you know that you are
pipelining requests (typically the case for GUI browsers, robots etc.) then
it is often not enough to just kill a single request as the whole pipeline
gets affected. Therefore, in that case you MUST call the
<TT><A HREF="HTHost.html#Pipeline">HTHost_killPipe</A></TT> function instead,
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_kill(HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<P>
Note that you can get to the HTHost object via the <A HREF="HTNet.html">HTNet
object</A> which you can <A HREF="#HTNet">get by calling
HTRequest_net(...)</A>.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Relations">Relations to Other Libwww Objects</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Request object is linked to a set of other libwww objects - here's how
to get to these objects...
<H3>
  <A NAME="Anchor">Binding to an Anchor Object</A>
</H3>
<P>
Every request object has an <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">anchor</A> associated
with it. The anchor normally lives until the application terminates but a
request object only lives as long as the request is being serviced. If the
anchor that we have requested is a child anchor then we always load
the parent anchor; after the load jump to the location. A child anchor
is a an anchor which points to a subpart of the document (has a "#" in the
URL).
<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setAnchor (HTRequest *request, HTAnchor *anchor);
extern HTParentAnchor * HTRequest_anchor (HTRequest *request);

extern HTChildAnchor * HTRequest_childAnchor (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  <A NAME="User">Binding to a User Profile</A>
</H3>
<P>
Each request is associated with a <A HREF="HTUser.html">User profile</A>
which contains information about the local host name, email address of the
user, news server etc. A request object is created with a default "generic
user" but can be assigned a specific user at any time.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_setUserProfile (HTRequest * request, HTUserProfile * up);
extern HTUserProfile * HTRequest_userProfile (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H3>
  <A NAME="HTNet">Binding to a Net Object</A>
</H3>
<P>
If a request is actually going on the net then the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net
Manager</A> is contacted to handle the request. The Net manager creates a
HTNEt object and links it to the Request object. You can get to the HTNet
object using the following functions.
<PRE>
extern HTNet * HTRequest_net (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_setNet (HTRequest * request, HTNet * net);
</PRE>
<P>
Note that you can go from the HTNet object to the
<A HREF="HTHost.html">HTHost</A> object by calling <TT>HTNet_host(...)</TT>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="Response">Binding to a Response Object</A>
</H3>
<P>
If a request is actually going on the net and we are getting a response back
then we also create a <A HREF="HTResponse.html">HTResponse object</A> and
bind it to the request object. Once we know what to do with the response,
we may transfer the information to the anchor object.
<PRE>
extern HTResponse * HTRequest_response (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_setResponse (HTRequest * request, HTResponse * response);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Method">Set the Method for the Request</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Method is the operation to be executed on the requested object. The default
set if the set of operations defined by the HTTP protocol, that is "GET",
"HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "LINK", "UNLINK", and "DELETE" but many of these can
be used in other protocols as well. The important thing is to think of the
requested element as an object on which you want to perform an operation.
Then it is for the specific protocol implementation to try and carry this
operation out. However, not all operations can be implemented (or make sense)
in all protocols.
<P>
Methods are handled by the <A HREF="HTMethod.html">Method Module</A>, and
the default value is "GET".
<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setMethod (HTRequest *request, HTMethod method);
extern HTMethod HTRequest_method (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Priority">Priority Management</A>
</H2>
<P>
The request can be assigned an initial priority which then gets inherited
by all <A HREF="HTNet.html">HTNet objects</A> and other requests objects
created as a result of this one. You can also assign a separate priority
to an indicidual HTNet object by using the methods in the
<A HREF="HTNet.html">Net manager</A>.
<PRE>
extern HTPriority HTRequest_priority (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_setPriority (HTRequest * request, HTPriority priority);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Pipelining">Pipelining Managament</A>
</H2>
<P>
Libwww supports HTTP/1.1 pipelining which greatly optimizes HTTP's behavior
over TCP. libwww also tries very hard to minimize the number of TCP packets
sent over the network. This is done by buffering outgoing requests until
either a minimum amount of data has been collected or a timeout causes a
flush to happen. The application can override the output buffering by explicit
request a request object to be flushed.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_setFlush (HTRequest * me, BOOL mode);
extern BOOL HTRequest_flush (HTRequest * me);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Force the Pipeline to be Flushed Immediately
</H3>
<P>
Forcing a fluch immediatly is slightly different as this can be done in
"retrospect". That is, if suddenly the application decides on performing
a flush after the request was initiated then it can use this function to
flush at a later time.
<PRE>
extern int HTRequest_forceFlush (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Error">Dealing with Request Error Messages</A>
</H2>
<P>
Errors are, like almost anything,  kept in lists. An error list can be
associated with a request using the following functions. In order to make 
life easier, there are also some easy mapping functions to the
<A HREF="HTError.html">HTError object</A>, so that you can add an error directly
to a request object.
<PRE>
extern HTList * HTRequest_error (HTRequest * request);
extern void HTRequest_setError	(HTRequest * request, HTList * list);
extern void HTRequest_deleteAllErrors (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<P>
These are the cover functions that go directly to the
<A HREF="HTError.html">Error Object</A>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_addError (HTRequest * 	request,
				HTSeverity	severity,
				BOOL		ignore,
				int		element,
				void *		par,
				unsigned int	length,
				char *		where);

extern BOOL HTRequest_addSystemError (HTRequest * 	request,
				      HTSeverity 	severity,
				      int		errornumber,
				      BOOL		ignore,
				      char *		syscall);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="MaxRetry">Max number of Retrys for a Down Load</A>
</H2>
<P>
Automatic reload can happen in two situations:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The server sends a redirection response
  <LI>
    The document has expired
</UL>
<P>
In order to avoid the Library going into an infinite loop, it is necessary
to keep track of the number of automatic reloads. Loops can occur if the
server has a reload to the same document or if the server sends back a Expires
header which has already expired. The default maximum number of automatic
reloads is 6.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_setMaxRetry (int newmax);
extern int  HTRequest_maxRetry (void);

extern int HTRequest_retrys (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_doRetry (HTRequest *request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_addRetry (HTRequest * request);

extern int HTRequest_AAretrys (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_addAARetry (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="MaxForward">Set Max Forwards for TRACE methods</A>
</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>TRACE</CODE> method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer
loop-back of the request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD
reflect the message received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200
(OK) response. The final recipient is either the origin server or the first
proxy or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request.
A <CODE>TRACE</CODE> request <I>MUST NOT</I> include an entity.
<PRE>extern BOOL HTRequest_setMaxForwards (HTRequest * request, int maxforwards);
extern int HTRequest_maxForwards (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="preemptive">Preemptive or Non-preemptive Access</A>
</H2>
<P>
An access scheme is defined with a default for using either preemptive (blocking
I/O) or non-preemptive (non-blocking I/O). This is basically a result of the
implementation of the protocol module itself. However, if non-blocking I/O
is the default then some times it is nice to be able to set the mode to blocking
instead. For example, when loading the first document (the home page),
blocking mode can be used instead of non-blocking.
<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setPreemptive (HTRequest *request, BOOL mode);
extern BOOL HTRequest_preemptive (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="conneg">Content Negotiation</A>
</H2>
<P>
When accessing the local file system, the Library is capable of performing
content negotioation as described by the HTTP protocol. This is mainly for
server applications, but some client applications might also want to use
content negotiation when accessing the local file system. This method enables
or disables content negotiation - the default value is <EM>ON</EM>.
<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setNegotiation (HTRequest *request, BOOL mode);
extern BOOL HTRequest_negotiation (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Preconditions">Request Preconditions (HTTP If-* Headers)</A>
</H2>
<P>
Should this request use preconditions when doing a <TT>PUT</TT> or a
<TT>POST</TT>? These are the "<TT>if-*</TT>" header fields that can be used
to avoid version conflicts etc. The default is not to use any preconsitions
(<TT>HT_NO_MATCH</TT>). The <TT>_THIS</TT> versions use etags and/or time
stamps and the <TT>_ANY</TT> versions use the "<TT>*</TT>" header field value
of the <TT>if-match</TT> and <TT>if-non-match</TT> header fields.
<PRE>typedef enum _HTPreconditions {
    HT_NO_MATCH = 0,

extern HTPreconditions HTRequest_preconditions (HTRequest * me);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Parsers">Local MIME header Parsers</A>
</H2>
<P>
MIMEParsers get their own type which is optimized for static and regex parser
strings.
<PRE>
typedef struct _HTMIMEParseSet HTMIMEParseSet;
extern void HTRequest_setMIMEParseSet (HTRequest *request,
				       HTMIMEParseSet * parseSet, BOOL local);
extern HTMIMEParseSet * HTRequest_MIMEParseSet (HTRequest *request,
					      BOOL * pLocal);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="default">Which Default Protocol Header Fields To Use?</A>
</H2>
<P>
Libwww supports a large set of headers that can be sent along with a request
(or a response for that matter). All headers can be either disabled or enabled
using bit flags that are defined in the following. See also the
<A HREF="#extra">section on how to extend the default set of supported header
fields</A>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="gnhd">General HTTP Header Mask</A>
</H3>
<P>
There are a few header fields which have general applicability for both request
and response mesages, but which do not apply to the communication parties
or theentity being transferred. This mask enables and disables these headers.
If the bit is not turned on they are not sent.

  <A NAME="extra">Extending The Default Set Of Header Fields</A>
</H2>
<P>
See also how to <A HREF="#default">set up default header fields</A>. There
are three ways to extend the set of headers that are sent in a request:
<OL>
  <LI>
    A simple <A HREF="HTAssoc.html">association list</A>
  <LI>
    A <A HREF="HTHeader.html">stream oriented approach where the stream (called

    add any header it likes.
  <LI>
    <A HREF="/Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/">HTTP extension mechanism</A> which
    is a much better way for handling extensions.
</OL>
<H3>
  1) Simple Association List
</H3>
<P>
Add the (name, value) and it will be converted into MIME header format as
name: value. Do NOT add <TT>CRLF</TT> line termination - this is done by
the HTTP header generator stream

<H2>
  <A NAME="Accept">User And Application Preferences Using Accept Headers</A>

The Accept family of headers is an important part of HTTP handling the format
negotiation. The Library supports both a global set of accept headers that
are used in <EM>all</EM> HTTP requests and a local set of accept headers
that are used in specific requests only. The global ones are defined in the
<A HREF="HTFormat.html">Format Manager</A>.
<P>
Each request can have its local set of accept headers that either are added
to the global set or replaces the global set of accept headers. Non of the
headers <EM>have</EM> to be set. If the global set is sufficient for all
requests then this us perfectly fine. If the parameter "override" is set
then only local accept headers are used, else <EM>both</EM> local and global
headers are used.
<H3>
  Content Types
</H3>
<P>
The <EM>local</EM> list of specific conversions which the format manager
can do in order to fulfill the request. It typically points to a list set
up on initialisation time for example by <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit()</A>.
There is also a <A HREF="HTFormat.html#z17"><EM>global</EM></A> list of
conversions which contains a generic set of possible conversions.

  <A NAME="Cache">HTTP Cache Validation and Cache Control</A>
</H2>
<P>
The Library has two concepts of caching: in memory and on file. When loading
a document, this flag can be set in order to define who can give a response
to the request. The memory buffer is considered to be equivalent to a history
buffer. That is, it doesn't not follow the same expiration mechanism that
is characteristic for a persistent file cache.
<P>
You can also set the cache to run in disconnected mode - see the
<A HREF="HTCache.html">Cache manager</A> for more details on how to do this.

<P>
When publishing to a server which doesn't accept a URL ending in "/", e.g,
the default Overview, index page, you can use
<CODE>HTRequest_setAltPutName</CODE> to setup the intended URL. If this
variable is defined, it'll be used during the cache lookup and update

  HTTP Cache Control Directives
</H3>
<P>
The cache control directives are all part of the cache control header and

<P>
The Expect request-header field is used to indicate that particular server
behaviors are required by the client. A server that does not understand or
is unable to comply with any of the expectation values in the Expect field
of a request MUST respond with appropriate error status.

  <A NAME="Partial">Partial Requests and Range Retrievals</A>
</H2>
<P>
Libwww can issue range requests in case we have already obtained a part of
the entity body. Since all HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages
as sequences of bytes, the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any
HTTP entity. (However, not all clients and servers need to support byte-range
operations.) Byte range specifications in HTTP apply to the sequence of bytes
in the entity-body (not necessarily the same as the message-body). A byte
range operation may specify a single range of bytes, or a set of ranges within
a single entity.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_addRange       (HTRequest * request,

  <A NAME="Access">HTTP Access Authentication Credentials</A>
</H2>
<P>
When a access denied response is returned to the Library, for example from
a remote HTTP server, this code is passed back to the application. The
application can then decide whether a new request should be established or
not. These two methods return the authentication information required to
issue a new request, that is the new anchor and any list of keywords associated
with this anchor.
<PRE>

The request object may have it's own before and after

global set in <A HREF="HTNet.html">HTNet</A>. The request object itself handles
the list element, that is this should not be freed bu the caller.
<H3>
  BEFORE Filters
</H3>
<P>
The BEFORE <A HREF="HTFilter.html">filters</A> are called just after the
request has been passed to the Library but before any request is issued over
the network. A BEFORE can infact stop a request completely from being processed.
<H4>
  Add a local BEFORE Filter
</H4>
<P>
You can add a local <I>BEFORE</I> filter for a single request so that the
both the local and global <I>BEFORE</I> filters are called or you can replace
the global filters with a local set. Note that the local set can be NULL.
This can be used to effectively disable all <I>BEFORE</I> filters without
unregistering the global ones.

with a local set. Note that the local set can be NULL. This can be used to
effectively disable all AFTER filters without unregistering the global ones.
<P>
AFTER filters can be registered to handle a certain set of return values

  <A NAME="App2Net">Sending data from App to Network</A>
</H2>
<P>
Multiple Request objects can be connected in order to create a
<A HREF="../User/Architecture/PostWeb.html">PostWeb</A> for sending data
from one location (source) to another (destination). Request objects are
bound together by connecting the output stream of the source with the input
stream of the destination requst. The connection can be done directly so
that the output from the source is exactly what is sent to the destination
or there can be a conversion between the two streams so that we can do
conversions on the fly while copying data. This is in fact the way we use
for building a proxy server.
<P>
The Library supports two ways of posting a data object to a remote destination:
Input comes from a socket descriptor or from memory. In the case where you
want to <EM>copy</EM> a URL, for example from local file system <EM>or</EM>
from a remote HTTP server then you must use the
<A HREF="../User/Architecture/PostWeb.html">PostWeb design</A>. This model
operates by using at least two request objects which gets linked to eachother
as part of the PostWeb model. However, if you are posting from memory, we
only use <EM>one</EM> request object to perform the operation. In order to
do this, the application must register a callback function that can be called
when the <A HREF="HTTP.c">HTTP client module</A> is ready for accepting data.
be included as part of the body and/or as extra metainformation. In the latter
case you need to register a callback function of the following type using
the methods provided in the next section.

extern void HTRequest_setPostCallback (HTRequest * request, HTPostCallback * cbf);
extern HTPostCallback * HTRequest_postCallback (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>
<P>
The Entity Anchor is either the anchor directly associated with the Request
object or the post anchor associated with the object. The purpose of the
entity anchor is if we are to send data to a remote server then we get the
metainformation using the entity anchor.

  <A NAME="context">Context Swapping</A>
</H2>
<P>
In multi threaded applications it is often required to keep track of the
context of a request so that when the Library returns a result of a request,
it can be put into the context it was in before the request was first passed
to the Library. This call back function allows the application to do this.

In case we are using a proxy for this requst then we can register it together
with the request object. That way we can find the proxy and look for
authentication information, for example in the

<H2>
Message Body Manipulation
</H2>
<P>
An application may use these functions to set and manipulate the request
message body.  This message body is specially indicate for methods that use
small XML message bodies. Once the application defines it, this message body
will be send just after the headers. It <STRONG> does not</STRONG> use
"<STRONG>Expect: 100-continue</STRONG>" header, and the application
<STRONG>should not</STRONG> try to use both.  It's important to remark that
"Expect: 100-continue" header is a very importante feature defined in HTTP.
It's prevents that, for example, the server must read many unnecessary bytes
from request body. Using "Expect: 100-continue" header, your application
safes time and network (see 
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</A>, section 8.2.3).
Please, if possible, use always HTRequest Entity and entity callback, leave
this only for small XML bodies in extension methods (see 
<A HREF="HTMethod.html">HTMethod</A>), and when using it, <STRONG>be very
careful</STRONG>!
<P>
When using a message body, the application may define its length and
format. If the message body is set and its length is also set and it greater
than 0, a Content-Lenght header will be added to the request. Similarly, if 
the message body and its type are set, a Content-Type header will be added 
to the request too. Otherwise, those headers will not be included.
<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: The caller should free the string returned by
HTRequest_messageBody function!

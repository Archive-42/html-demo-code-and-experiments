The Timer class handles timers for libwww and the application. This works
exactly as in X where you create a timer object with a callback function
and a timeout. The callback will be called every time the timer expires.
There are several timeouts that can be set in libwww:
<OL>
  <LI>
    The time we keep an idle persistent connection open. Here there are in fact
    two mechanisms depending on whether you use blocking or non-blocking sockets.
    The default is 60 secs. The timers can be accessed using the functions defined
    in the <A HREF="HTHost.html#Persistent">HTHost object</A>
  <LI>
    The idle time we want to wait when receiving a response from a server, that
    is, if it doesn't send anything in a number of secs. The default here is
    no timeout. It can be accessed in the
    <A HREF="HTHost.html#RequestTimeout">HTHost object</A> as well.
  <LI>
    The timeout before we flush pending requests in a pipeline, the default here
    is 30 ms. It is also accessed in the <A HREF="HTHost.html#Delayed">HTHost
    object</A>
  <LI>
    The timeout before we start sending the body of a <TT>PUT</TT> or
    <TT>POST</TT> request. Normally we send the <TT>Expect: 100-continue</TT>
    header field but if the server doesn't send back a <TT>100 Continue</TT>
    code then we upload the body anyway. The default is 2 secs and can be accessed
    in the <A HREF="HTTP.html">HTTP module</A>.

  Create and Delete Timers
</H2>
<P>
The callback function is the function that is to be called when timer expires.
<PRE>
extern HTTimer * HTTimer_new (HTTimer *, HTTimerCallback *, 
			      void *, ms_t millis,
                              BOOL relative, BOOL repetitive);

extern BOOL HTTimer_deleteAll (void);
extern BOOL HTTimer_expireAll (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Dispatch Timer
</H2>
<P>
Just do it
<PRE>
extern int HTTimer_dispatch (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Get the next timer in line
</H3>
<P>
Dispatches all expired timers and optionally returns the time till the next
one.
<PRE>
extern int HTTimer_next (ms_t * pSoonest);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Reset an already existing Repetitive Timer
</H3>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTimer_refresh(HTTimer * timer, ms_t now);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Get Information about a Timer Object
</H2>
<H3>
  Absolute Time when This Timer Expires
</H3>
<P>
Absolute time in millies when this timer will expire
<PRE>
extern ms_t HTTimer_expiresAbsolute (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Relative Time this Timer is running
</H3>
<P>
Gived the relative time in millies that this timer was registered with. For
example, a relative timer set to expire in 20ms will return 20.
<PRE>
#define HTTimer_getTime(t)	HTTimer_expiresRelative(t)
extern ms_t HTTimer_expiresRelative (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Has this Timer Expired?
</H3>
<P>
If so then it's time to call the dispatcher!
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTimer_hasTimerExpired (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  What callback is this Timer Registered with?
</H3>
<PRE>
extern HTTimerCallback * HTTimer_callback (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Is this Time relative or Absolute?
</H3>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTimer_isRelative (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Platform Specific Timers
</H2>
<P>
On some platform, timers are supported via events or other OS specific
mechanisms. You can make libwww can support these by registering a platform
specific timer add and timer delete method.
<PRE>
typedef BOOL HTTimerSetCallback (HTTimer * timer);

extern BOOL HTTimer_registerSetTimerCallback (HTTimerSetCallback * cbf);
extern BOOL HTTimer_registerDeleteTimerCallback (HTTimerSetCallback * cbf);

<P>
This module does not actually perform the WAIS protocol directly, but it
does using one or more libraries of the freeWAIS distribution. The ui.a library
came with the old free WAIS from TMC, the client.a and wais.a libraries are
needed from the freeWAIS from <A HREF="http://www.cnidr.org">CNIDR</A>.
<P>
If you include this module in the library, you must also
<UL>
  <LI>
    Compile the Library by including the <CODE>--with-wais </CODE>directive in
    the <A HREF="../../INSTALL.html">configure script</A>.
  <LI>
    Have the WAIS Library available
</UL>
<P>
The wais source files are parsed by a separate and independent module,
<A NAME="z1" HREF="HTWSRC.html">HTWSRC</A>. You can include HTWSRC without
including direct wais using this module, and your WWW code will be able to
read source files, and access WAIS indexes through a gateway.
<P>
A <A HREF="../User/WAIS.html" NAME="z2">WAIS-WWW gateway</A> is just a normal
Web server with a libwww compiled with this module.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTWAIS.c">HTWAIS.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

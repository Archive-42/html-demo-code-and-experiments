<P>
This module is the private part of the request object. It has the functions
declarations that are private to the Library and that shouldn't be used by
applications. The module has been separated from the old HTAccess module.
See also the public part of the declarition in the <A HREF="HTReq.html">HTReq
Module</A>.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTReqMan.c">HTReqMan.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

<P>
When a request is handled, all kinds of things about it need to be passed
along together with a request. It is intended to live as long as the request
is still active, but can be deleted as soon as it has terminated. Only the
anchor object stays around after the request itself is terminated.

</PRE>
<H3>
Message body
</H3>
<P>
A request message body indicated for XML bodies. It is used for extension
methods. See <A HREF="HTReq.html">HTReq.html</A> for details.
<PRE>
#ifdef HT_EXT
    char *             messageBody;
    long int           messageBodyLength;
    HTFormat           messageBodyFormat;
#endif
</PRE>
<H3>
  User Profile
</H3>
<P>
Each request can be assigned a <A HREF="HTUser.html">user profile</A> containing
information about this host and the user issuing the request.
<PRE>
    HTUserProfile *	userprofile;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Net Object
</H3>
<P>
Each request is assigned a Net object which contains pointers to other objects
handling the request.
<PRE>
    HTNet *		net;		    /* Information about socket etc. */
</PRE>
<H3>
  Response Object
</H3>
<P>
When we start getting MIME headers in as a response we keep it in this object
until we know what to do with it.
<PRE>
    HTResponse *        response;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Error Manager
</H3>
<PRE>
    HTList *		error_stack;		           /* List of errors */
</PRE>
<H3>
  Have many times do We Want to Try?
</H3>
<PRE>
    int			retrys;       	      /* Number of automatic reloads */
    int                 max_forwards;
    int			AAretrys;      	      /* Number of authentication
                                                 retries */
</PRE>
<H3>
  Preemptive or Non-Preemptive load?
</H3>
<P>
Each protocol module is registered with a default behavior but if you have
registered a protocol module for non-preemtive load you can override this
by using the following flag.
<PRE>
    BOOL		preemptive;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Content Negotiation
</H3>
<P>
Normally, when we access the local file system we do content negotiation
in order to find the most suited representation. However, you can turn this
off by using the following flag.
<PRE>
    BOOL		ContentNegotiation;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Should we use preconditions?
</H3>
<PRE>
    HTPreconditions     preconditions;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Headers and header information
</H3>
<P>
These are the masks that decides what headers to send.
<PRE>
    HTGnHd		GenMask;
    HTRsHd		ResponseMask;
    HTRqHd		RequestMask;
    HTEnHd		EntityMask;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Local MIME Header Parsers
</H3>
<P>
Each request can be assigned its own MIME header parsers.
<PRE>
    HTMIMEParseSet *	parseSet;
    BOOL		pars_local;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Accept headers
</H3>
<P>
These are the accept headers that we want to send out.
<PRE>
    HTList *		conversions;
    BOOL		conv_local;

    HTList *		encodings;
    BOOL		enc_local;

    HTList *		tes;
    BOOL		te_local;

    HTList *		languages;
    BOOL		lang_local;

    HTList *		charsets;
    BOOL		char_local;

    HTList *		befores;
    BOOL		befores_local;

    HTList *		afters;
    BOOL		afters_local;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Are we using a Proxy?
</H3>
<P>
If so then we keep the name in this variable
<PRE>
    char * 		proxy;
    BOOL                full_uri;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Cache Control Directives
</H3>
<P>
This association list is a list of the cache control directives that are
to be sent as part of the <CODE>Cache-Control</CODE> header.
<PRE>
    HTReload		reload;
    HTAssocList *       cache_control;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Default PUT name
</H3>
<P>
Stores the default name when publishing to a "/" URL.

</PRE>
<H3>
  Byte Ranges
</H3>

<H3>
  Connection Control Directives
</H3>
<P>
This association list is a list of the connection control directives that
are to be sent as part of the <CODE>Connection</CODE> header.
<PRE>
    HTAssocList *       connection;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Expect Directives
</H3>
<P>
The Expect request-header field is used to indicate that particular server
behaviors are required by the client. A server that does not understand or
is unable to comply with any of the expectation values in the Expect field
of a request MUST respond with appropriate error status.
<PRE>
    HTAssocList *       expect;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Access Authentication Information
</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>credentials</CODE> list contains the information that we are to
send as part of the <CODE>Authorization</CODE> header. The realm is if we
already know that we need to generate credentials for a specific realm.
<PRE>
    char *		realm;				    /* Current realm */
    HTAssocList *	credentials;	   /* Credentials received by server */
</PRE>

</H3>
<P>
  <HR>
<H4>
  1) Simple Association List
</H4>
<P>
Add the (name, value) and it will be converted into MIME header format as
<CODE>name: value</CODE>. DO NOT ADD CRLF line termination - this is done
by the <A HREF="HTTPReq.html">HTTP header generator stream</A>
<PRE>
    HTAssocList	*	extra_headers;
</PRE>
<H4>
  2) Stream Oriented Header Generators

    BOOL		gens_local;
</PRE>
<H4>
  4) HTTP Extension Framework

    HTAssocList *	optional;

These functions are mainly used internally in the Library but there is no
reason for them not to be public.

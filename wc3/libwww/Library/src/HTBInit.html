As mentioned in the <A HREF="../User/Architecture/">Library Architecture</A>,
libwww consists of a small core and a large set of hooks for adding
functionality. By itself, the core it not capable of performing any Web related
tasks like accessing a HTTP server or parsing a HTML document. All this
functionality must be registered by the application. This way, the core of
libwww is kept application independent and can be used as the basic building
block for any kind of Web application. The Library comes with a large set
of default functions, for example for accessing HTTP and FTP servers, parsing
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC
822</A> headers etc. This module helps the application programmer setting
up all this functionality, but it is important to note that none of it is
<I>required</I> in order to use the Library.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTBInit.c">HTBInit.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/">W3C Sample Code
Library</A>. You can also have a look at the other
<A HREF="WWWInit.html">Initialization modules</A>.

  Default File Suffix Binding
</H2>
<P>
Register the default set of bindings between file suffixes and media types.
This is used for example to guess the media type of a FTP URL of a local
file URL.

As part of the HTTP content negotiation, a server must be able to match the
preferences sent by the client in an HTTP request with the possible set of
documents that it has avaiable for this URL. For example , it may have an
English and a Danish version in which case it looks at the
<CODE>Accept-Language</CODE> header and sees what the client prefers. The
Library has a simple "Match" algorithm for finding the best as specified
by the HTTP specification. As the content algorithm is part of the File Interface
then all file access regardless of whether it is from a server or a client
application will be able to content negotiotion.

This function is used when the best match among several possible documents
is to be found as a function of the accept headers sent in the client request.

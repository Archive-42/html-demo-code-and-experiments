The Tee stream just writes everything you put into it into two other
streams. One use (the only use?!) is for taking a cached copey on disk
while loading the main copy, without having to wait for the disk copy
to be finished and reread it. <P>

You can create a T stream using this method. Each stream returns a
return value and in order to resolve conflicts in the return code you
can specify a resolver callback function. Each time any of the data
methods are called the resolver function is then called with the
return codes from the two streams. The return code of the T stream
itself will be the result of the resolver function. If you pass NULL
as the resolver routine then a default resolver is used.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTTee.c">HTTee.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C
Sample Code Library</A>.

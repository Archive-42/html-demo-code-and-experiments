The Buffered Socket Writer Stream is an <A HREF="HTIOStream.html">output
stream </A>&nbsp;which knows how to write to a BSD type socket. It is part
of the <A HREF="WWWTrans.html">Transport interface </A>and may be registered
as part of a <A HREF="HTTrans.html">Transport Object</A>. The application
can&nbsp;initialize this stream together with the
<A HREF="HTReader.html">HTReader stream</A>, for example. In the
<A HREF="HTInit.html">default initialization module</A>, you can find the
<CODE>HTTransportInit()</CODE> function which sets up this stream as a default
transport for handling unbuffered socket write operations.
<P>
The difference from the <A HREF="HTWriter.html">unbuffered write stream</A>
is that this stream lets you write characters without causing a
<CODE>write</CODE> system call every time. The data is first written into
a buffer. Data is written to the transport only when the buffer is full,
or when the stream is flushed.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTBufWrt.c">HTBufWrt.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/">W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

  Default Output Buffering
</H2>
<P>
In order to optimize reading a channel, we bind a buffer to each channel
object. The size of this buffer is a compromise between speed and memory.
By default, we have chosen a value frequently used in TCP connections. In
the stream creation method you can pass any other buffer size. In the case
of 0, we take the default size.

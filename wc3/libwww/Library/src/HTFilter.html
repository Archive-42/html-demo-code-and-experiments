  Standard BEFORE and AFTER Filters

<P>
This module provides a set of default <B>BEFORE</B> and <B>AFTER</B> filters
that can be registered by the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net manager</A> to be
called before and after a request. All filters can be registered either to
be called <I>globally</I> (all requests) or <I>locally</I> (pr request basis).
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTFilter.c">HTFilter.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

  BEFORE Filters
</H2>
<P>
This is a standard set of <B>BEFORE</B> filters which the application may
initialize. This can be done in an easy way using the function
<CODE>HTBeforeInit()</CODE> in the <A HREF="WWWInit.html">Initialization
interface</A>.
<H3>
  Proxy and Gateway BEFORE filter
</H3>
<P>
Checks for registerd proxy servers or gateways and sees whether this request
should be redirected to a proxy or a gateway. Proxies have higher priority
than gateways so we look for them first! For HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 we may
only send a full URL (including the host portion) to proxy servers. Therefore,
we tell the Library whether to use the full URL or the traditional HTTP one
without the host part.
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTProxyFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Rule Translation BEFORE Filter
</H3>
<P>
If we have a set of rules loaded (see the Rule manager) then check before
each request whether how that should be translated. The trick is that a parent
anchor has a "address" which is the part from the URL we used when we created
the anchor. However, it also have a "physical address" which is the place
we are actually going to look for the resource. Hence this filter translates
from the address to the physical address (if any translations are found)
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTRuleFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Memory Cache (History List) Validation BEFORE Filter
</H3>
<P>
Check if document is already loaded. The user can define whether the history
list should follow normal expiration or work as a traditional history list
where expired documents are not updated. We don't check for anything but
existence proof of a document associated with the anchor as the definition
is left to the application.
<PRE>
extern HTNetBefore HTMemoryCacheFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Client side authentication BEFORE filter
</H3>
<P>
The filter generates the credentials required to access a document Getting
the credentials may involve asking the user in which case we use the methods
registered by the <A HREF="HTAlert.html">HTAlert module</A>
<PRE>    
extern HTNetBefore HTCredentialsFilter;
</PRE>
<H2>
  AFTER Filters
</H2>
<P>
Like <B>BEFORE</B> filters we provide a default set of typical <B>AFTER</B>
filters that may be initialized by the application. Again, an easy way of
doing this is to call the <CODE>HTAfterInit()</CODE> function in the
<A HREF="WWWInit.html">Initialization interface</A>.
<H3>
  Error and Information filter
</H3>
<P>
It checks the status code from a request and generates an error/information
message if required.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTInfoFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Redirection filter
</H3>
<P>
The redirection handler only handles automatic redirections on the <CODE>GET</CODE>
or <CODE>HEAD</CODE> method (or any other safe method). The users is asked for
all other methods.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTRedirectFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Proxy Redirection filter
</H3>
<P>
This filter handles a "<CODE>305 Use Proxy"</CODE> response and retries the
request through the proxy
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTUseProxyFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Client side authentication filter
</H3>
<P>
The client side authentication filter uses the user dialog messages registered
in the <A HREF="HTAlert.html">HTAlert module</A>. By default these are the
ones used by the line mode browser but you can just register something else.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTAuthFilter;
</PRE>
<H3>
  Client side authentication information filter
</H3>
<P>
This filter updates the client's local authentication information database 
with new information sent by the server via the authentication-info header.
This header is currently used only by the Digest authentication scheme.
This filter is initialized by default, but you can just register something
else.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTAuthInfoFilter;

<H3>
  Request Common Log File Filter
</H3>
<P>
Default Logging filter using the log manager provided by the
<A HREF="HTLog.html">Log Manager</A>.
<PRE>
extern HTNetAfter HTLogFilter;
</PRE>

<H3>
  Request Referer Log File Filter
</H3>
<P>
Default Referer Log filter using the log manager provided by the
<A HREF="HTLog.html">Log Manager</A>.

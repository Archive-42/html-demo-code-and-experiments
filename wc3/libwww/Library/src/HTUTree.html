A <I>URL tree</I> is a hierarchical container class that is well suited for
storing information about a URL hierarchy. The <I>root</I> of a URL tree
is the <I>hostname</I> part of the URL, for example
<CODE>www.w3.org:8000</CODE>.&nbsp;Client application can use URL trees to
store what they know about remote servers, for example the access authentication,
PICS labels and PEP modules required to access a specific URL from a remote
server. However, URL trees can also be used on server side to contain information
about the server tree, for example what parts of the tree is protected etc.
<P>
There are three components of the URL tree which all can be searched for
using the methods declared in this module.
<UL>
  <LI>
    The Tree itself
  <LI>
    A URL Node which represents a hierarchy level in a URL
  <LI>
    A URL Template which can span multiple nodes and are very similar to the
    realms known from for example Basic Access Authentication in HTTP.
</UL>
<P>
Typically, a URL tree will be empty when the application starts and as time
goes by and we get to know more about the remote servers that we have access,
the URL trees will contain more and more information. A nice feature about
URL trees is that the application can interpolate information based on realms
and templates. This gives the application a good chance of guessing what
information (for example a set of credentials) should be appended to a new
request.
<P>
We do not currently distinguish between multiple access mechanisms, for example
<B>HTTP</B> and <B>FTP</B>, however, URL trees are mostly used within the
HTTP domain.
<P>
<I>URL Trees</I> are often used by <A HREF="HTFilter.html">filters</A> which
stores information about remote services, Each filter can have its own URL
tree&nbsp;<I>or</I> a URL tree can be shared among multiple filters.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTUTree.c">HTUTree.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Library/"> W3C Sample Code
Library</A>.

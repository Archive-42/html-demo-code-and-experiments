  Web Commander Solves the Lost Update Problem
</H1>
<P>
The <A HREF="/Collaboration/Locking">Lost Update Problem</A> has been present
in most distributed authoring sessions using rudimentary HTTP/1.0 features.
the Web Commander can now demonstrate how to avoid this problem based on
HTTP/1.1 features including persistent cache, strong etags, <TT>if-match</TT>
header fields and <TT>HEAD</TT> requests.
<P>
A couple of notes:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Web Commander uses the normal <A HREF="../Library/src/HTReq.html">libwww
    Request API</A> without modifications
  <LI>
    As the requests contain the <TT>TE</TT> header field indicating that the
    client understands deflate, the server sends back deflated and chunked responses
  <LI>
    Web Commander only detects conflicts - it doesn't try to resolve them
</UL>
<H3>
  Saving a Document for the First Time
</H3>
<P>
If the user wants to save a document that we don't know anything about then
we have to issue a <TT>HEAD</TT> request before doing the save using a
<TT>PUT</TT> request. The <TT>HEAD</TT> request is necessary as we don't
know whether we are speaking to an HTTP/1.0 or an HTTP/1.1 server - only
the latter understands etags. Note, that the <TT>PUT</TT> request uses the
"<TT>If-None-Match: *</TT>" header field to ensure that no race condition
occurs between the two requests. There are two situations that have to be
handled:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <EM><A HREF="tcpdumps/new-entry.txt">The document doesn't already
    exist</A></EM>
  <DD>
    The first trace shows a situation where the document doesn't exist and the
    <TT>PUT</TT> request is executed normally
  <DT>
    <EM><A HREF="tcpdumps/replace-entry.txt">The document already exists</A></EM>
  <DD>
    The second trace shows a situation where the document already exists. The
    user is then given two options in a GUI dialog box: to download the existing
    version or to override it. In the trace the user overrides the existing version
    which is done by removing any preconditions.
</DL>
<H3>
  Saving a Document for the 2nd or more Time
</H3>
<P>
When a new document has been created on the server, it sends back an etag
in the <TT>201 (Created)</TT> response. This etag is stored in our
<A HREF="../Library/src/HTCache.html">persistent HTTP/1.1 cache</A>. Once
the etag is known, it is used on all subsequent <TT>PUT</TT> requests in
a <TT>if-match</TT> header field. If the document hasn't changed, the etags
will match and the <TT>PUT</TT> can proceed. However, if it has changed,
then the etags will not match and the <TT>PUT</TT> can not proceed. Instead
the user will be given the same two options as above, that is, either to
get the new version or to override it.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <EM><A HREF="tcpdumps/update-entry.txt">The document has not been
    changed</A></EM>
  <DD>
    This trace shows a <TT>PUT</TT> request with a&nbsp;<TT>if-match</TT> header
    field. In this situation the etag matches and the <TT>PUT</TT> request is
    executed as normal.
  <DT>
    <EM><A HREF="tcpdumps/override-entry.txt">The document has been
    changed</A></EM>
  <DD>
    The last trace shows a situation where someone else updated the document
    and so the etags don't match anymore. THe PUT therefore fails and the user
    is then presented with the option of downloading the new version of overriding
    the existing one. In this case, the existing version is simply overridden.
</DL>
<P>
In both cases, the new etag sent back is saved in the persistent cache and
the old etag deleted.

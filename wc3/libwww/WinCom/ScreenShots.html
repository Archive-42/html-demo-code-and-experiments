<h1>Web Commander Help and Screen Shots </h1>

<p>The goal of Web Commander is to give users an easy way of saving web documents to a
server, and loading them to a local file or deleting them from a server. Web Commander has
three basic commands corresponding to the goals: save, load and delete. If necessary,
&nbsp; it is also possible to use the tool to do some advanced settings.</p>

browser doesn't understand the <a HREF="/TR/png">PNG image format</a> then they will show
up as broken images.</em></p>

<h2><a name="Saving a Document">Saving a Document</a></h2>

<h3><a name="General Case">General Case</a></h3>

<p>The most common use of this tool is when a user wants to save a document residing
locally on his or her computer to a web server (HTTP server). This can be done by using
the save document command. First you need to fill in the <em>Source</em> field with your
local document name or use the <em>Browse</em> button to select the document.&nbsp; The <em>Destination</em>
field contains the web address where you file is going to be saved to. To do the save you
just need to press the <em>Submit</em> button and you are done after you receive a
feedback message. In some rare occasions you may get an error message back. Usually this
is because of a <a href="#Solving Version Conflicts">version conflict</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="ScreenShots/app" ALT="Save from local file" BORDER="0"></p>

<p>When the document that is being saved resides in your local disk, it has<em> file:</em>
at the beginning of the document pathname referring to local file address schema. The
document may also reside on an FTP server or on an HTTP server. In that case<em> ftp:</em>
and <em>http</em>: schemas are used correspondingly.</p>

<p ALIGN="Center"><img SRC="ScreenShots/SaveFromHTTP" ALT="Save from HTTP" BORDER="0"> </p>

<p ALIGN="left">Web Commander can handle any type of document including binary formats,
tar files, programs, etc. </p>

<h3><a name="Solving Version Conflicts">Solving Version Conflicts </a></h3>

<p>If somebody has saved an updated version of the same document that you are trying to
save, Web Commander detects it and asks you what to do. </p>

<p ALIGN="Center"><img SRC="ScreenShots/conflict"
ALT="Screenshot of version conflict resolution" BORDER="0"> </p>

<p>This feature can be turned on and off under the Options menu. </p>

<h3><a name="Source Information">Source Information</a></h3>

<p>Normally these settings are not needed while saving the documents. If you want to see
what guesses are automatically being made of your source document, push the <em>Guess</em>
button.</p>

<h3><a name="Link Relationships">Link Relationships</a></h3>

<p>Normally these settings are not needed. They can be used to add document relations to
set of documents. For instance, if you are writing a book, you can define with <em>next</em>
and <em>prev</em> type links that the source document containing one chapter of the book
comes after one document and is before another.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="Left"><a name="Loading a Document">Loading a Document</a> </h2>

<p ALIGN="Left">You can also use Web Commander to simply load a document either from an
HTTP server or an FTP server. The cache directives can help you reloading a document that
you know has been changed in the mean time. Normally you can just use the default setting
which is to get the nearest version that appears fresh. </p>

<h2><a name="Deleting a Document">Deleting a Document</a> </h2>

<p>Web Commander can be used to delete a document on an HTTP server </p>

<p ALIGN="Center"><img SRC="ScreenShots/DeleteDocument" ALT="Delete a document" BORDER="0">

<h3><a name="Proxy Setup and SSH Tunnelling">Proxy Setup and SSH Tunnelling</a> </h3>

<p>The proxy setup is very flexible as you can use regular expressions to say which
request should go there. In this example, all requests going to <tt>http://jigedit.w3.org/*</tt>
are tunnelled through a local host SSH tunnel ensuring real security. You can also do
things like proxying all requests ending in &quot;<tt>.png</tt>&quot; though a particular
proxy. </p>

<p ALIGN="Center"><img SRC="ScreenShots/proxy" ALT="Proxy setup with regular expressions"

<p>It could of course also be a normal HTTP proxy sitting on a firewall. </p>

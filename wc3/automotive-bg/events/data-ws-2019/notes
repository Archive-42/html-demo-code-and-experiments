Like other design docs, your explainer should:

Introduce the problem and explain the motivation for solving it
State assumptions
Provide evidence or argument that this problem is important to solve
List goals
List explicit non-goals
Discuss key use-cases - it has to cover the motivating examples youâ€™re considering in your design
Propose a solution
Provide example code that ties together problem, proposed solution and how it enables the listed use-cases
Discuss alternative designs that were considered (or may be explored in future iterations) with pros/cons. You might want to include the rationale for any controversial decisions you made, for example in tradeoffs between functionality and security..

        <h3>Executive summary</h3>

	
<p>Transportation has been seeing considerable disruption and rapid
innovation in recent years, creating a multitude
of new business opportunities, increasing safety, efficiency and flexibility. The emerging technical trends are being driven by information generated
across a wide range of sources spanning all modes of
transportation. Parallel advances in sensors, communications, cloud
computing, analytics, geophysical mapping, machine learning, mobile
devices, user interfaces and related areas have created a rich
foundation. The main obstacle to achieving the full
potential is a lack of compatibility
and interoperability.</p>

<p>
This wealth of information can be leveraged to improve the passenger experience,
provide entertainment,
improve efficiency, maintenance, safety, and convenience. It can reduce
traffic congestion, harmful emissions and substantially raise the standard of living
for our cities. All of this is possible if we can move away from silo
approaches that inhibit information exchanges.</p>

	<p>The workshop attracted a broad range of participants from Tech
companies, Telematics Service Providers, Tier One supplier, Automotive
Manufacturers, Researchers, Regulators, Open Source Initiatives,
Geographical Information System Solution Providers, Standards
Development Organizations and Startups.</p>

<p>Specifically we had attendees from:</p>

<p>Apple, Autonomics, Baker McKenzie, BMW, Continental Automotive,
Deutsche Telekom AG, Drive Sweden, ETSI, EURECOM, Federal Highway Administration, Fujitsu Limited, GENIVI Alliance, Geotab, Ghent University, HERE, iFOSSF, Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Mondeca, NIO USA, NMFTA, Open Geospatial Consortium, Ridar Systems, New York University, SRI International, Toyota, Uber, University of Southampton, University of Toronto, University of Toronto, US Department of Transportation, Volvo, W3C/MIT</p>

	<p>We shared experiences, use case studies, 
	new
	directions and insights on what's needed for the next
	generation of transportation data standards.</p>

<p>Goal of increasing awareness of efforts and problems was achieved,
clearly establishing the need for
better coordination and identified concrete <a href="#recommend">next steps to enact as a
result of this workshop</a>.</p>

	        <section id="introduction">

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
	  
	  <p>The catalyst for holding this workshop was two
	  fold.</p>
	  <p>First the <a href="/auto">W3C Automotive Working
	    Group (WG)</a> is starting to see implementations of its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/">Vehicle
	    Information Service Specification (VISS)</a> being 
	    deployed into production vehicles. VISS exposes <a
	    href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/">GENIVI's
	    Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)</a>, a data model to provide a
	    harmonized, standard for the wealth of information
	    available within modern vehicles.
	    Every other auto manufacturer
	    currently does data differently and exposes it with
	    proprietary interfaces. While several
	    automotive manufacturers in addition to those
	    participating in the W3C Auto WG have expressed a need for this
	    standard, they remain hesitant to adopt as rearchitecting their vehicles
	    is a significant investment.
	  </p><p>The W3C Auto WG sees the need for harmonizing this
	  information not only within vehicles but in the cloud and with other
	  standards efforts. We want to ensure the data we are
	  exposing in-vehicle and bringing to the cloud fits into a
	  broader transportation data marketplace.</p>
	    
	    <p>The second motivator for holding this workshop was to
	    address the limited awareness not just of our standards but
	    related ones as well as all the 
	    innovative prototypes, experiments and proprietary, 
	    commercial solutions. These efforts need to be better
	    aligned in order to achieve the sort of widespread interoperability
	    desireable for modernizing transportation. 
	    </p>

	<p>The workshop had attendees from several Standards
	Development Organizations (SDO) actively creating
	standards around transportation:</p>

	</ul>
      <p>There were a total of twenty four 
      SDO identified working in
      transportation space, majority of which were not present.</p>

 <p>     
      Intelligent Transport Systems standards work has been going on since
      1992, yet surprisingly few people attending the workshop were aware of the
      scope of their work. This was particularly notable given that the audience was largely comprised of
      technologists working in the transportation space. Similar could
      be said of the other standards efforts representing a
      significant, wider problem resulting in parallel instead of
      coordinated efforts.
 </p>
 
 <p>In the workshop we learned of need to better coordinate
 efforts to harmonize data architectures even within individual
 companies. Too often initiatives create their own architectures
 instead of leveraging existing solutions, creating islands of
 information (silos), often lacking semantics, metadata and other data
 design choices that would significantly
 increase its future usefulness.</p>

 <p>Nation-centric initiatives to harmonize data are compounding the
 problem, coming at the
 expense of international standard solutions, forcing manufacturers
 and solution providers to address regional regulatory requirements.
 </p>
 
<p><blockquote>"Standards are the first step towards the holy grail of
an interoperable, plug-and-play world where cities can mix and match
solutions from different vendors without fear of lock-in or
obsolescence or dead-end initiatives."</blockquote> - <a href="https://www.iso.org/sites/worldsmartcity/">Jesse Berst (Chairman, Smart Cities Council)</a></p>

 <p>It starts with the data! Shared information relies most
 fundamentally on a common description of the underlying data
 itself. A major message throughout the workshop was that protocols,
 serialization, authentication et al of all the various standard
 and proprietary efforts underway aside, we should endeavor to speak
 the same language in the form of common data definitions when possible, at least at the cloud
 ontological level. A functional data marketplace would flourish,
 broadly enabling varied partnerships and collaborations.</p>

<p>The lack of coordination is inhibiting the widespread
interoperability potential, corresponding business opportunities and
cascade of benefits to society.</p>

      <section id="topics"><h3>Topics</h3>

      <p>The W3C Transportation Data Workshop covered a <a href=
    "https://www.w3.org/auto/events/data-ws-2019/schedule">wide range
      of topics</a>, summarized here and in <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/auto/events/data-ws-2019/minutes">minutes</a>.</p>
      
      <h4 id="data">Data</h4>

      <p>Not surprisingly numerous data topics featured prominently at a workshop on
      transportation data. The term data
      can be flung around casually, it is not uncommon to hear a company representative
      saying they have it without quantifying what it is they have or
      its range of potential uses beyond the original intent. 
      </p><p>
      All data is not created equal. As mentioned, too often data
      is produced for a single or narrow set of purposes making it
      less useful if not outright useless in other contexts.  What is
      available was acquired to solve a specific problem, probably lacking
      metadata on sampling methodology employed, degree of precision
      and relationships. There are potentially additional data points that might
      have been available and simply not collected.</p>
	  
      <p>The answer isn't to try to attain and
      store all information either as burden, bandwidth, storage and
      other costs will be incurred without necessarily adding
      value. There should be thoughtful curation on what is brought to
      the cloud, at times evaluating and acting upon
      information at the edge is what is needed. </p>
      
<p><blockquote>"The Data is permanent and enduring, and applications can come and
go."</blockquote> - Adnan Bekan (BMW)</p>

<p>The ability to evolve a solution is directly related to the
information available. A survey of all feasible information that can
be attained should be taken into consideration when data structures
are designed even if some is not to be collected initially. </p>

<p>Information is not knowledge but required in order to attain
it. Lack of knowledge is ignorance.</p>

 <blockquote>
      <p><b>Ignorance</b> \Ig"no*rance\, n. [F., fr. L. ignorantia.]</p>
      <p> 1. The condition of being ignorant; the lack of knowledge in
        general, or in relation to a particular subject; the state
        of being uneducated or uninformed.<br />
        [1913 Webster]</p>

     <p>2. (Theol.) A willful neglect or refusal to acquire knowledge
        which one may acquire and it is his duty to have. --Book
        of Common Prayer.<br />
        [1913 Webster]</p>
 </blockquote>

      <p>Information is a commodity but without pertinent information,
      high quality, consistency and proper assessment it lacks value. There needs to be
      enough data points and metadata to perform meaningful analysis.
      The ability to act meaningfully has
      far greater worth than raw data itself. Sound reasoned
      assessments can also provide actionable information while
      stripping away personal identifying or otherwise sensitive information.</p>

      <p>Conversely absent pertinent information tends to do more
      harm than good and result in flawed reasoning. For
example a hard breaking event in a vehicle is typically viewed by
insurance carrier algorithms as bad
driving behavior where the individual was potentially distracted and needed to make a dramatic
correction to avoid collision. The driver may have been reacting to
something sudden, unforeseeable and outside their control and should
be rewarded instead of penalized on their insurance score. Without
proper context and full situational understanding this sort of algorithmic bias produces
false assumptions and poor business decisions.</p>

<p>A sound approach being pushed for data architecture that should be
applied to transportation space is Extensible Entity Data
Modeling. Core data models should be used
wherever possible, resisting the tendency to reinvent the wheel with a
custom, monolithic, single use data
design. This allows for a common understanding of the information
across vendors and domains without the need to do custom translation
or mapping. Custom mapping can bridge paradigms but is brittle, requiring ongoing
maintenance as definitions change, further challenged by different
deployment timelines and prone to periods of incompatibility. Needs
for a given application or service beyond the core model can be added as
logical extensions.</p>

<p>These modular ontology extensions can be unique or better shared
understanding among mutual stakeholders and become widely used
conventions or standards themselves
over time. They represent the special needs beyond the core
ontologies used, this additional data on relationship edge enable
artificial intelligence and data analysts to make
more ready use of the information. 
</p>
      <p>
      Route planning algorithms are built on underlying data models. 
Different models make comparison or use of information in different
algorithms difficult if not impossible. This becomes more important
when trying to create multi-modal transportation solutions across
different vendors and sources. Adhering to core models with logical
extensions as warranted for a given mode or vendor allows for more
ready inclusion in multi-modal travel planning.</p>

      
      <h4 id="world">Defining the Physical World</h4>

      <p>As this digital transformation of transportation starts to
      take shape, it is paramount we have shared understanding of the
      dimensions of time and space. It is all the more important as autonomous vehicles
      are being added to the mix.  When giving coordinates for a
      vehicle are you talking about its center, left front edge,
      other? We simply cannot have variation by manufacturer on these
      fundamental concepts and operate safely.</p>

      <p>Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and W3C have a strong, existing
      liaison in the form of the Spatial Data on the Web Interest
      Group which maintains a number of standards on time and sensor
      data ontologies along with <a
      href="https://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/">Best Practices</a> for
      Spatial Data on the Web. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/">Semantic Sensor Network Ontology</a>
      specification is aligned with OGC/ISO Observations
  and Measurements standards.</p>

<p>There are considerable challenges of defining physical
      space to guide the trajectories of moving objects traveling around this planet. Spatial
      object relationships are constantly changing. The physical
      world itself is far from sedentary, rife with changing features from tectonic
      plate movement, erosion, shifting of magnetic north. There are
      multiple representations of the physical geometries with
different strengths, purposes and intended audiences.</p>


      <h4 id="privacy">Privacy and data ownership</h4>

      <p>To make efficient, tailored multi-modal travel recommendations a system
      needs to know an individual's whereabouts, destination,
      preferred means of travel, what specific transportation services the user
      already has subscription accounts with and any special
      requirements such as accessibility, additional passenger, baggage or cargo needs.</p><p>Information is both an asset for service offerings
      and a liability to the individuals who it is about and the companies entrusted
      with the safe handling of it. Significant concerns about
      possible misuse are well warranted as it
      presents a huge risk of invasion of privacy and subsequently
      physical safety.</p>
      
      <p>Of the various solutions discussed there were some recurring
      themes regarding privacy such as empowering users to protect,
      temporarily entrust, own and migrate their data. Access control
      has currently advanced with some not only at the record level but
      regularly down to field granularity. This control is even applied
      whether the company with the information is acting on
      it directly themselves or acting as an entrusted provider for sharing with
      third parties for specific, approved uses.</p>

      <p>Researchers at Ghent are using MIT SOLID (Social Linked Data)
      project for handling user data in their mobility prototype. The SOLID project is led by W3C
      Director and Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, it empowers individual
      data ownership and ability to transport it between data
      providers. It's a decentralized instead of typically siloed approach, allowing
      individuals to choose which services to share what data end
      points with based on preferences, transportation service
      subscriptions and requirements. As with other efforts discussed
      it endeavors to 
      align with at least several
      concepts of GDPR and other privacy legislation and
      conventions.</p><p>Another presenter promoted a 
      solution utilizing proxy re-encryption with policy specific keys for safer handling and
      storage of personal identifying information with the ability to
      provide user authorized access when warranted.</p>

      
      <p>The EU SPECIAL
      (Scalable Policy-awarE linked data arChitecture for prIvacy, trAnsparency and compLiance)
      project is working to solve the nuanced complexities with policy
      language, policies themselves and deployment of engines
      enforcing them based on purpose and clearly captured user
      consent.</p>
      
      <p>Regulations have consequences and in the EU and North America
      all heavy
      vehicles are required to report certain data to regulators to
      ensure compliance with various laws. Fleet managers use this
      wealth of information to not only comply with regulations but
      improve operations. The possibility of a telematics service
      provider shuttering its business will immediately ground all
      their fleet customers demonstrating the clear need of
      portability of data to allow migration across providers.</p>

      <p>We covered only some of the wide range of complexities surrounding protecting personal data
      that needs to be acted on in order to provide appropriate,
      personalized transportation solutions. Many of the privacy problems are
      not unique to transportation, only intensified.</p>
      
<h4 id="auto">Cars on the information superhighway</h4>

<p>We delved further into W3C's Automotive specification 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/">Vehicle
	    Information Service Specification (VISS)</a> which
	    provides an API for exposing <a
	    href="https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/">GENIVI's
	    Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)</a> to applications
	    running in the vehicle or potentially indirectly over the
	    cloud. There are many use cases for needing to operate local
	    logic for sampling data or interacting with the
	    vehicle. Applications running locally with a VISS instance
	    can reside on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI, aka head
	    unit which is the stereo/screen in the center of the
	    dashboard of modern vehicles), a Telematic Control Unit
	    (TCU), other embedded device or a trusted paired one such
as a smartphone.</p>
<p>The information coming from connected vehicles are a fundamental
building block in the digitized transportation space. Outreach with
various potential interested sectors such as regulators, insurance,
tech companies is gaining momentum as this standard is now in some
production vehicles. The W3C Auto group wants to ensure the data it is
producing finds consumers in not only new and existing businesses but
can fit as an important piece in other, broader transportation
standards' puzzles.</p>

<h4 id="ally">Accessibility</h4>
<p>We discussed the need for including Accessibility use
cases and requirements in initial designs instead as an
afterthought. Incorporating later will be more cumbersome for the
solution provider and results likely rife with inadequacies.</p>

<p>This market share is not negligible with an estimated 15% of
Americans have some form of accessibility concerns. Depending on individuals' needs, their reliance on various mixed
modes of public and private transportation is likely higher. Besides
being the right thing to do, designing for Accessibility will reduce
potential of lawsuits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and
similar legislation in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>Special needs of a passenger needs to be conveyed while retaining
privacy, alerting for instance a rideshare driver that his passenger
is visually impaired an will be unable to recognize the vehicle based
on make, model, color and license plate. How intelligent would a SmartCity solution look leaving a
wheelchair bound passenger on a subway platform without an elevator
egress?  We delved briefly into real world examples of current transportation
offerings.</p>

  <h4 id="market">Data marketplace</h4>
  <p>We covered many of the requirements for creating healthy data
  marketplaces in the <a href="#data">data topic</a>, adding
  usefulness and value to information. Assessments instead of raw data
  can also be more readily actionable on plus safer to distribute with fewer
  privacy concerns. The types of commodities and derivatives that can
  be exchanged in a transportation data marketplace can enable new
  businesses to form.</p>
  <p>Geotab's presentation included the claim that they could practically map all the roads in US and Canada within
      a day based on the number and geographic spread of connected
      vehicles they collect information from. They can also identify

      <h4 id="smaht">IoT/SmartCities</h4>
      <p>IoT is fragmented as badly if not worse than automotive,
      lacking interop between thing manufacturers. Of the 
      many standards efforts in IoT space, we discussed SAREF and W3C's 
      Web of Things (WoT).</p>
      
 <p>Smart Appliances REFerence ontology (SAREF) is an “interoperability
 language" enabling semantic interoperability between different
 systems again illustrating how well defined data is central to interoperability.</p>

 <p>BMW presented VSSo (VSS ontology) an ontology built on top of
 GENIVI Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) developed by them in
 collaboration with EURECOM. It defines a taxonomy for attributes,
 sensors and actuators of vehicles. In addition to bringing data to the cloud
 for analytics and providing a solid offering in a data marketplace,
 VSSo can be leveraged to create a thing description in W3C's Web of
 Things. A proof of concept demo was shared where this thing
 description allowed for defining what arbitrary thing capabilities
 can be readily opened up to IoT interoperability.</p>
<p>VSSo leverages sensor and time ontologies mentioned previously,
created as an OGC/W3C collaborating, following extensible design
principles. EURECOM is to bring VSSo to W3C for standardization.</p>

<p>We were joined by the chief data architects from the University of
Toronto behind the SmartCities standards effort. They shared with us
their ontological work arranging at service, city and foundation
levels. How they can be leveraged for transportation planning,
future infrastructure needs, predicting impact of road construction
and making  They shared how the silos and proprietary tools approach restricts information
access for these broader needs, putting limitations and additional
work in trying to bridge understanding.

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>

    <h4>Improve Coordination</h4>
    
    <p>The main recommendation is to increase coordination on data
    models across standards efforts, starting with the ones
    present. Since the workshop we have established formal and
    informal liaisons and have set up a Transportation Ontology
    Coordination Committee (TOCC). It is initially comprised of
    participants from ISO SmartCities, ISO Intelligent Transportation
    Systems, Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and W3C. We will seek to
    involve additional standards bodies involved in transportation as
    work gets more established.</p>

    <h4>Data design principles</h4>
    
    <p>We agreed on fundamental data architecture design, using core
    ontologies that will reduce duplication of efforts and are
    extensible for different, purpose specific representations.</p>

    <h4>Core ontologies</h4>
    
    <p>We came up with a prioritized list of core ontologies needed in
    transportation space, starting with routing, generic core and
    extensible for segments using different modes of transportation. OGC has since come up with a Routing API and
    corresponding ontology in discussion in TOCC. Observations are
    next order and also has a start within OGC. </p>

    <h4>Relaunch Business Group</h4>

    <p>W3C relaunched its Automotive Webplatform Business Group as the
    Automotive and Transportation Business Group to continue
    coordination within the broader transportation space. TOCC resides
    as a joint task force within this Business Group 
    and the W3C Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group (SDWIG) which
    is an OGC/W3C collaboration.</p>

    <p>Automotive and Transportation Business Group Areas of work: [<a
    href="https://www.w3.org/2020/auto-transportation-charter">Charter</a>]</p>
	    <ul>	    
	      <li>Coordination with GENIVI on Vehicle Signal
	      Specification (VSS)</li>
	      <li>Development of VSS ontology (VSSo)</li>
	      <li>Graph, 'Gen2' and other pilot/demo projects </li>
	      	      <li>Develop In-Vehicle application Best
		      Practices</li>
		      <li>Create or coordinate with other groups
		      development of Policy Guidelines surrounding data usage</li>
	      <li>Promote VSS, VSSo and W3C Automotive service standards</li>
	      <li>Coordinate on development of transportation related ontologies</li>
	      <li>Continue to act as an incubator for W3C Automotive
	      Working Group</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>The in-vehicle application Best Practices will shape
	    expectations of third party behavior in interacting and
	    collecting information on the vehicle from safety,
	    security and privacy perspectives allowing policies to be
	    defined and enforceable. At the vehicle edge is where data
	    will originate and inform operator of collection,
	    potentially capturing their consent.</p>
	    

	    <h4>Accessibility</h4>

	    <p>Strive to ensure accessibility is taking into
	    consideration at the outset of transportation data
	    modeling, creating structure to hold specific capabilities
	    and information useful in facilitating travel. We are
	    encouraging solution designs to specifically seek
	    accessibility review. As part of
	    our continued outreach after the workshop, we have
	    found individuals focused on this particular area and have
	    encouraged the formation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/lda/">Linked Data for Accessibility Community Group</a>
	    that will collaborate with Automotive and Transportation
	    Business Group, Spatial Data on the Web Interest Group and
	    Linked Building Data Community Group.</p>

	    <h4>Increase Awareness</h4>

	    <p>To help stem off duplicate efforts and instead rally
	    them on shared data models, we are encouraging attendees
	    and all other interested parties to act as ambassadors for
	    this shared message. We set up a publicly archived mailing
	    list (@@) for sharing ideas and fostering ongoing collaboration.</p>
	    <p>W3C staff are working with various trade associations,
	    standards bodies and think tanks to spread the word in
	    aftermarket, manufacturer, fleet, insurance, regulator, transportation
	    services and other sectors. Do please make us aware of
	    opportunities to present.</p>

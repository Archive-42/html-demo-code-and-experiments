    <section>
      <p>Data is increasingly important for all aspects of
      transportation. organisations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. The falling costs for storage and processing is driving interest in extracting competitive value from ever larger amounts of data through analytics and data hungry AI algorithms. In addition, organisations are seeking to exploit opportunities for sharing data within emerging digital ecosystems.</p>
      <p>A W3C Workshop is now planned for early 2019 on emerging standardisation opportunities. This will be a two day workshop, spread over three days, that brings together people with an interest in the future of standards relating to data, drawing upon the experience gained over the last two decades. The workshop will look at the emerging standardisation opportunities relating to the growth of graph databases, the relationship to AI and machine learning, and what's needed to better support scaling across communities, including remote access to data and services.</p>

      <p>For more details on the conference, see the <a href="./">Data Workshop page</a>.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring the W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Data leadership and helps move the dialog forward.</p>

        <h3 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h3>
        <p>The cost to hold a workshop includes costs for venue (including setup and custodial costs), AV requirements (optionally including recording), catering (lunch and breaks), materials, travel and staffing, and other considerations.</p>

        <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.</p>

        <p>If you see value in discussing the expected evolutions of networking and Web technologies, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution of the Web.</p>

        <p>The more sponsorships we get, the better the amenities will be, including options like recording and transcription for spreading and preserving what was discussed, and better meals.</p>

      <h2>Intent of Visible Controls</h2>

      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user interface components (controls) can be found easily by people with cognitive disabilities, vision loss, and mobility and motor impairments.</p>

      <p>Some design approaches hide controls and require certain user interactions (such as mouseover) to display them. Where the hidden controls are needed to complete tasks, the difficulty in discovering the controls can leave some users with disabilities without a path forward.</p>

      <h3>Cognitive disabilities</h3>

      <p>People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find hidden controls. If a hidden control is needed in order to progress, this can prevent some users from completing a task. Users who discover controls that display on hover may not remember how to show and operate the controls the next time they interact with the site. So even when a user is able to proceed, time on task can be affected for both one-time and repeated uses.</p>
    
      <h3>Vision loss</h3>

      <p>People with vision loss may not see controls that display only on hover or focus, particularly if they display outside of the viewport. For users who require enlarged or magnified content, the portion of the content in the viewport may be significantly reduced. Low vision users may have 800 x 600 resolution as the default browser zoom. They may look closely at the monitor, say four inches from the display, due to limited acuity (inability to see detail) or Scotomas (blind spots). One of the main challenges for people with vision loss is simply locating related controls on the screen, moving the mouse from control to control, and getting the keyboard to the point where they are looking. They may have a significant amount of head and neck movement while using content. When users don't see something on the screen, they may assume they are missing it — for example, that it’s in their blind spot or hidden in a menu — and go searching until they either find it or give up searching. This success criterion can help reduce that cumulative load.</p>
 
      <h3>Mobility and motor impairments</h3>

      <p>People who use alternative input methods may have difficulty locating and operating controls that display only on hover or focus. For example, speech recognition users activate controls by speaking the name of the control. Functions that are only exposed through hover interaction or keyboard focus pose significant barriers to alternative input methods, such as speech.</p>

      <h3>When Needed</h3>
      
      <p>Ideally the information needed to identify controls exist would be visible all the time. Controls can be available through a persistent visible entry point, such as a menu button that opens subitems. There are also several exceptions outlined in the criterion text:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>If controls are provided in multiple locations on a page or at multiple points within a process, at least one of the instances of the control must be visible without hover interaction or keyboard focus. For example, on an email listing page some controls such as trash may be visible using pointer hover in the inbox list view. Those controls are always visible on the email page so they do not need to be persistently visible on the inbox view.</li>
         <li>If the control is to enhance keyboard navigation. For example, a link that skips from the top of the page to the navigation could become visible only on focus.</li>
         <li>If there is a mechanism to make the indicators persistently visible. For example, a button at the top of the page could make all the hidden controls visible without needing to hover over them.</li>
         <li>If hiding the information needed to identify the component is essential. For example, a memory game hides the controls for selecting a card to flip over.</li>
      </ul>

		<h3>Embedded Controls</h3>
		
      <p>Information needed to identify user interface components is usually the component itself; however, there are situations where controls are not visible. Complex components such as video players and carousels often include controls that are visible on hover. The presence of the complex component — for example, the carousel component or the video image — provides the “Information needed to identify the user interface components.” For a carousel, controls displayed on hover should also be displayed when the carousel is activated. For a video player, activating the video image should launch the video (sometimes in a new window), at which point more video player controls, including controls displayed previously on hover, should be visible. Some users may still struggle if video controls are not persistently visible, so there is benefit to providing a mechanism that allows users to have the controls persistently visible.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Visible Controls</h2>
      
      <ul>
         <li>People with cognitive and learning disabilities can more easily locate controls that allow them to successfully progress through a process.</li>
         <li>People with memory impairments do not need to remember where controls are located.</li>
        <li>People with low vision do not need to combine visually searching for controls with moving pointer hover or keyboard focus.</li>
        <li>People with mobility and motor impairments who use speech or other input methods do not need to use hover or focus to locate and operate controls.</li>
      </ul>
      
   </section>
   
   <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples of Visible Controls</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Indication of which fields are editable: </strong>
         In a web editor, once a page is open for editing, all possible fields that can be activated to edit always display a clear visible activation control, such as a pencil icon.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable user to always show controls hidden until revealed by hover:</strong> In a web editor that reveals hidden editing controls when a user hovers over them, a setting can be changed so that the editing controls are always shown by default, without requiring a hover event.</li>
      <li><strong>Visible access to email controls: </strong> When viewing a list of emails the controls needed to delete or forward the email are not visible unless hovered. When an email has been selected the same controls are persistently visible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Other success criteria apply to the requirement for controls being “visible." Visibility is not limited to appearing graphically on the screen, but also includes following a meaningful sequence, not relying on sensory characteristics, and all other requirements under <a href="../../understanding/distinguishable">1.4: Distinguishable</a>.</p>

   <h1>Understanding Resize text</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Resize text</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually rendered text, including
         text-based controls (text characters that have been displayed so that they can be
         seen [vs. text characters that are still in data form such as ASCII]) can be scaled
         successfully so that it can be read directly by people with mild visual disabilities,
         without requiring the use of assistive technology such as a screen magnifier. Users
         may benefit from scaling all content on the Web page, but text is most critical. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The scaling of content is primarily a user agent responsibility. User agents that
         satisfy 
         <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/guidelines.html#tech-configure-text-scale">UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1</a> allow users to configure text scale. The author's responsibility is to create Web
         content that does not prevent the user agent from scaling the content effectively.
         Authors may satisfy this Success Criterion by verifying that content does not interfere
         with user agent support for resizing text, including text-based controls, or by providing
         direct support for resizing text or changing the layout. An example of direct support
         might be via server-side script that can be used to assign different style sheets.
      </p>
      
      <p>The author cannot rely on the user agent to satisfy this Success Criterion for HTML
         content if users do not have access to a user agent with zoom support. For example,
         if they work in an environment that requires them to use IE 6.
      </p>
      
      <p>If the author is using a technology whose user agents do not provide zoom support,
         the author is responsible to provide this type of functionality directly or to provide
         content that works with the type of functionality provided by the user agent. If the
         user agent doesn't provide zoom functionality but does let the the user change the
         text size, the author is responsible for ensuring that the content remains usable
         when the text is resized. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Some user interface components that function as a label and require activation by
         the user to access content are not wide enough to accommodate the label's content.
         For example, in Web mail applications the subject column may not be wide enough to
         accommodate every possible subject header, but activating the subject header takes
         the user to the full message with the full subject header. In Web-based spreadsheets,
         cell content that is too long to be displayed in a column can be truncated, and the
         full content of the cell is available to the user when the cell receives focus. The
         content of a user interface component may also become too wide in user interfaces
         where the user can resize the column width. In this type of user interface component,
         line wrapping is not required; truncation is acceptable if the component's full content
         is available on focus or after user activation and an indication that this information
         can be accessed, is provided to the user in some way besides the fact that it is truncated.
      </p>
      
      <p>Content satisfies the Success Criterion if it can be scaled up to 200%, that is, up
         to twice the width and height. Authors may support scaling beyond that limit, however,
         as scaling becomes more extreme, adaptive layouts may introduce usability problems.
         For example, words may be too wide to fit into the horizontal space available to them,
         causing them to be truncated; layout constraints may cause text to overlap with other
         content when it is scaled larger; or only one word of a sentence may fit on each line,
         causing the sentence to be displayed as a vertical column of text that is difficult
         to read. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The working group feels that 200% is a reasonable accommodation that can support a
         wide range of designs and layouts, and complements older screen magnifiers that provide
         a minimum magnification of 200%. Above 200%, zoom (which resizes text, images, and
         layout regions and creates a larger canvas that may require both horizontal and vertical
         scrolling) may be more effective than text resizing. Assistive technology dedicated
         to zoom support would usually be used in such a situation and may provide better accessibility
         than attempts by the author to support the user directly.
      </p>
      
      <div class="note">
         
         <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate, and therefore
            we suggest using text wherever possible. It is also harder to change foreground and
            background contrast and color combinations for images of text, which are necessary
            for some users.

      <ul>
         
         <li>
            A user with vision impairments increases the text size on a Web page in a browser
            from 1 em to 1.2 ems. While the user could not read the text at the smaller size,
            she can read the larger text. All the information on the page is still displayed when
            the larger font is used for the text.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            A Web page contains a control for changing the scale of the page. Selecting different
            settings changes the layout of the page to use the best design for that scale.
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            A user uses a zoom function in his user agent to change the scale of the content.
            All the content scales uniformly, and the user agent provides scroll bars, if necessary.

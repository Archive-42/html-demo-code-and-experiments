   <h1>Understanding Keyboard</h1>
   
   
   <section id="intent">
      <h2>Intent of Keyboard</h2>
      
      
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content
         can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface (so an alternate keyboard
         can be used). When content can be operated through a keyboard or alternate keyboard,
         it is operable by people with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that
         require eye-hand coordination) as well as by people who must use alternate keyboards
         or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech
         input software, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and
         a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards. Individuals with low
         vision also may have trouble tracking a pointer and find the use of software much
         easier (or only possible) if they can control it from the keyboard.
      </p>
      
      <p>Examples of "specific timings for individual keystrokes" include situations where
         a user would be required to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period
         of time or where a key must be held down for an extended period before the keystroke
         is registered. 
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The phrase "except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the
         path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints" is included to separate those
         things that cannot reasonably be controlled from a keyboard.
      </p>
      
      <p>Most actions carried out by a pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (for
         example, clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). However, there is a small class of
         input that is done with a pointing device that cannot be done from the keyboard in
         any known fashion without requiring an inordinate number of keystrokes. Free hand
         drawing, watercolor painting, and flying a helicopter through an obstacle course are
         all examples of functions that require path dependent input. Drawing straight lines,
         regular geometric shapes, re-sizing windows and dragging objects to a location (when
         the path to that location is not relevant) do not require path dependent input.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not a
         keyboard equivalent to the application; it is a mouse equivalent (i.e., it looks like
         a mouse to the application).
      </p>
      
      <p>It is assumed that the design of user input features takes into account that operating
         system keyboard accessibility features may be in use. For example, modifier key locking
         may be turned on. Content continues to function in such an environment, not sending
         events that would collide with the modifier key lock to produce unexpected results.

      <ul>
         
         <li>People who are blind (who cannot use devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination)</li>
         
         <li>People with low vision (who may have trouble finding or tracking a pointer indicator
            on screen)
         </li>
         
         <li>
            Some people with hand tremors find using a mouse very difficult and therefore usually
            use a keyboard

            </p>
            
            <p>A drawing program allows users to create, size, position and rotate objects from the
               keyboard.
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <p>An application that uses drag and drop also supports "cut" and "paste" or form controls
               to move objects.
            </p>

               <strong>Example 3: Moving between and connecting discrete points.</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A connect-the-dots program allows the user to move between dots on a screen and use
               the spacebar to connect the current dot to the previous one.

               <strong>Example 4: Exception - Painting Program.</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A watercolor painting program passes as an exception because the brush strokes vary
               depending on the speed and duration of the movements.

               <strong>Example 5: Exception - Model helicopter flight training simulator.</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A model helicopter flight training simulator passes as an exception because the nature
               of the simulator is to teach real-time behavior of a model helicopter.
            </p>

            <p>
               								       
               <strong>Example 6: A PDA with an optional keyboard</strong>
               							     
            </p>
            
            <p>A PDA device that is usually operated via a stylus has an optional keyboard that can
               be attached.  The keyboard allows full Web browsing in standard fashion.  The Web
               content is operable because it was designed to work with keyboard-only access.

Authors might not be able to rely on settings being at the platform or media player level and might need to provide an option to enable this in the content depending on the technology relied upon to make a conformance claim to ensure the technique is accessibility supported.</p></div></section><section id="G142"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G142.html">G142</a>: Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>The Zoom functionality in IE 7.0 does not always scale uniformly when absolute positioning is used and the page is scaled smaller.

This includes IE, all versions of Firefox, Mozilla, and Opera after version 6.</p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>When specified colors are overridden in Netscape and versions of Firefox before Firefox 3.0, most Javascript pop-up boxes and drop-down menus become unusable. Pop-up boxes gain a transparent background, superimposing the text of the box on the text of the page, and drop-down menus either become transparent or gain a dark-grey background.</p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>IE 6 will not override background colors in the browser unless the same background color has also been selected in the system settings.</p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>There are no color settings in Safari so it is not possible to over-ride specified colors. Similarly where colors are not specified Safari displays the page in black text on a white background, ignoring any color preferences from within the system settings.</p></div></section></body></html>

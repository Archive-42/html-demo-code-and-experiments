Standard CSS layout behavior causes relative scaling to be multiplied, so the scaling of text within elements will be different in subtle ways. Firefox and IE7 do not change the scaling of the content based on the system settings in a way that affects CSS layout, so this effect does not occur in those browsers.</p></div></section><section id="C13"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C13.html">C13</a>: Using named font sizes</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>When font size is given in absolute units of measurement, such as points or pixels, the Text Size menu commands in Internet Explorer 7 and earlier do not resize the text.</p></div></section><section id="C14"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C14.html">C14</a>: Using em units for font sizes</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>In Internet Explorer 6, using ems for font sizes will cause the text to grow more than using % or named font sizes. So, text-size/largest, might cause the text to grow more than 200% and have clipping problems.</p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>When font size is given in absolute units of measurement, such as points or pixels, the Text Size menu commands in Internet Explorer 7 and earlier do not resize the text.</p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>Internet Explorer 7 only changes the text size when the style rule that applies to the text is defined within a style element; when using inline styles, that is, using an element's <code>style</code> attribute, the text size change is not supported.</p></div></section><section id="C15"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C15.html">C15</a>: Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>Internet Explorer 6.0 and earlier versions for Windows do not support dynamic pseudo-classes for any elements except hyperlinks. Internet Explorer 7 does not support :focus styles for elements other than hyperlinks. Include the :active CSS pseudo class to achieve the same effect as :focus in Internet Explorer for (X)HTML links (a element). </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>Firefox 1.5, Firefox 2.0 and SeaMonkey 1.1 for Windows support dynamic pseudo-classes for text input fields, text areas, radio buttons, check boxes, select elements, submit/reset buttons, and button elements. However, setting different colors or borders when a radio button or a check box receives focus is not supported. </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>Opera 9.02 for Windows supports dynamic pseudo-classes for text input fields, text areas, radio buttons, check boxes, select elements, submit/reset buttons, but not for button elements. </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>Firefox 2.0, Opera 9.02 and SeaMonkey 1.1 for Windows also support adjacent sibling selectors for form labels. Firefox 1.5, Internet Explorer 6.0 and earlier versions for Windows do not support adjacent sibling selectors for form labels. </p></div></section><section id="C18"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C18.html">C18</a>: Using CSS margin and padding rules instead of spacer images for layout design</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>On the Microsoft Windows platform, Internet Explorer 5, Internet Explorer 5.5, Internet Explorer 6.0 in "quirks mode" and Internet Explorer 7 in "quirks mode" use a box model that deviates from the W3C CSS specification: in these browser versions, right and left padding, and right and left borders do not increase the total width of an element, so the space for the content inside such an element will be narrower. (This behavior is known as the "box model bug".) Internet Explorer 5.5 on Mac OS, and Internet Explorer 6 and 7 on Windows in "standards compliant mode" use the box model defined in the W3C CSS specification.</p></div></section><section id="C23"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C23.html">C23</a>: Specifying text and background colors of secondary content such as banners, features and navigation in CSS while not specifying text and background colors of the main content</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>Most browsers allow the user to change the color settings to override the Web page's CSS and HTML color schemes. This is supported by all versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, and Opera after version 6. </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>When specified colors are overridden in Netscape and versions of Firefox before Firefox 3.0, most Javascript pop-up boxes and drop-down menus become unusable. Pop-up boxes gain a transparent background, superimposing the text of the box on the text of the page, and drop-down menus either become transparent or gain a dark-grey background. </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>Internet Explorer 6 will not override background colors unless the same background color has also been selected in the system settings. </p></div><div class="ua-issue"><p>There are no color settings in Safari so it is not possible to over-ride specified colors. Similarly where colors are not specified Safari displays the page in black text on a white background, ignoring any color preferences from within the system settings.</p></div></section><section id="C25"><h2><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C25.html">C25</a>: Specifying borders and layout in CSS to delineate areas of a Web page while not specifying text and text-background colors</h2><div class="ua-issue"><p>Most browsers allow the user to change the color settings to override Web author's CSS and HTML color schemes.

Firefox and later versions of IE do not resize fonts in High Contrast Mode, and don't have this issue. </p></div></section></body></html>

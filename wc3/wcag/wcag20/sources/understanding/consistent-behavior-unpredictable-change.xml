      <head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that entering data or selecting a form control has predictable effects. Changing the setting of any user interface component is changing some aspect in the control that will persist when the user is no longer interacting with it. So checking a checkbox, entering text into a text field, or changing the selected option in a list control changes its setting, but activating a link or a button does not. Changes in context can confuse users who do not easily perceive the change or are easily distracted by changes. Changes of context are appropriate only when it is clear that such a change will happen in response to the user's action. 
            </p>
      <note>
         <p>This Success Criterion covers changes in context due to changing the setting of a control. Clicking on links or tabs in a tab control is activating the control, not changing the setting of that control.</p>
      </note>
      <note>
         <p>What is meant by "component" and "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".</p>

               <p>This Success Criterion helps users with disabilities by making interactive content more predictable. Unexpected changes of context can be so disorienting for users with visual disabilities or cognitive limitations that they are unable to use the content.

               <p>Individuals who are unable to detect changes of context are less likely to become disoriented while navigating a site. For example:

                     <p>Individuals who are blind or have low vision may have difficulty knowing when a visual context change has occurred, such as a new window popping up. In this case, warning users of context changes in advance minimizes confusion when the user discovers that the back button no longer behaves as expected.

              A form is provided for creating calendar entries in a Web based calendaring and scheduling application. Along with the standard fields for subject, time and location, there is a set of radio buttons to select the type of calendar entry to create.  The calendar entry type can be meeting, appointment or reminder.  If the user selects the radio for meeting, additional fields are displayed on the page for entering the meeting participants. Different fields appear if the reminder button is chosen. Because only parts of the entry change and the overall structure remains the same the basic context remains for the user.

              A form contains fields representing US phone numbers. All of the numbers have a three digit area code followed by a three digit prefix and finally a four digit number, and each part of the phone number is entered into a separate field. When the user completes the entry of one field the focus automatically moves to the next field of the phone number. This behavior of phone fields is described for the user at the beginning of the form.

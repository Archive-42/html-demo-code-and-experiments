      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid consequences that may result from making a mistake when submitting form data. This criterion builds on <loc href="minimize-error-reversible"
              linktype="guideline">Success Criterion 3.3.4</loc> in that it applies to all forms that require users to submit information. </p>
      <p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes and may have more difficulty detecting or recovering from mistakes. People with reading disabilities may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake. Providing the ability to review and correct information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action.</p>

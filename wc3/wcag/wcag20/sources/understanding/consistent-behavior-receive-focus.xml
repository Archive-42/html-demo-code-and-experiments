      <head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that functionality is predictable as visitors navigate their way through a document. Any component that is able to trigger an event when it receives focus must not change the context.          Examples of changing context when a component receives focus include, but are not limited to:
          </p>
      <ulist>
         <item>
            <p>forms submitted automatically when a component receives focus;</p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p>new windows launched when a component receives focus;</p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p>focus is changed to another component when that component receives focus;</p>
         </item>
      </ulist>
      <p>Focus may be moved to a control either via the keyboard (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> tabbing to a control) or the mouse (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> clicking on a text field). Moving the mouse over a control does not move the focus unless scripting implements this behavior. Note that for some types of controls, clicking on a control may also activate the control (<abbr expansion="for example">e.g.</abbr> button), which may, in turn, initiate a change in context.

      <note>
         <p>What is meant by "component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element" or "user interface component''.</p>

								       <emph role="bold">Example 1:  A dropdown menu</emph>
							     </p>
            <p>A dropdown menu on a page allows users to choose between jump destinations. If the person uses the keyboard to move down to a choice and activates it (with a spacebar or enter key) it will jump to a new page.  However, if the person moves down to a choice and either hits the escape or the tab key to move out of the pulldown menu â€“ it does not jump to a new screen as the focus shifts out of the dropdown menu. </p>

                  Example of a Failure:  A help dialog
                </emph>
							     </p>
            <p>
                When a field receives focus, a help dialog window describing the field and providing options opens. As a keyboard user tabs through the Web page, the dialog opens, moving the keyboard focus away from the control every time the user attempts to tab past the field.

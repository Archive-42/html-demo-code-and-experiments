      <head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that <emph role="bold">all</emph> content is operable from the keyboard. This is the same as Success Criterion 2.1.1, except that no exceptions are allowed. This does not mean that content where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints (excluded from the requirements of 2.1.1) must be made keyboard accessible. Rather, it means that content that uses path-dependent input cannot conform to this Success Criterion and therefore cannot meet Guideline 2.1 at Level AAA. </p>

      <head>Intent of this Success Criterion</head>
      <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access information that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.</p>
      <p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older users do not see color well. In addition, people using text-only, limited-color or monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented only in color.</p>
      <p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red", “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that a required field had been left blank.</p>
      <note>
         <p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is redundant with other visual indication.</p>

								       <emph role="bold">A form that uses color and text to indicate required fields</emph>
							     </p>
            <p>A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the top of the form explain that required fields are labeled with red text and also with an icon whose text alternative says, "Required." Both the red text and the icon are programmatically associated with the appropriate form fields so that assistive technology users can determine the required fields.

							     </p>
            <p>Students view an SVG image of a chemical compound and identify the chemical elements present based on the colors and numbers used in the diagram. The text alternatives associated with each element name the color of the element and indicate the element's position in the diagram. Students who cannot perceive color have the same information about the compound as their classmates. (This technique also satisfies <loc href="text-equiv-all"

							     </p>
            <p>
                Form elements which are disabled via markup or scripting, are greyed out and made inactive by the user agent. When in the disabled state these elements do not receive focus. Assistive technologies can programmatically determine the state of disabled elements and will provide this information to the user as the elements are encountered on the page. The change in color and loss of focus provides redundant, visual information about the state of the control.

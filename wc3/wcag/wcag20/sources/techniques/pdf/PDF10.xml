   <description>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that users of assistive
    				technology are able to perceive form control labels and understand
    				how form controls are used. </p>
      <p>Form controls allow users to interact with a PDF document by filling
    				in information or indicating choices which can then be submitted for
    				processing. Assistive technology users must be able to recognize and
    				understand the form fields, make selections, and provide input to complete
    				the forms, and submit the form, just as sighted users can. Understandable
    				labels that convey the purpose of each form control are essential to
    				form accessibility. </p>
      <p>Form inputs generally have labels and instructions to help users understand
    				what information is required and how to fill in the form. Unless these
    				labels are programmatically associated with the relevant fields, assistive
    				technology might not be able to associate them correctly, and thus
    				users might not understand how to complete the form. </p>
      <p>Using Adobe Acrobat Pro with documents with interactive forms, you
    				can make sure that the forms are accessible and usable by making sure
    				that programmatically associated labels that convey the purpose of
    				the fields are provided. </p>
      <p>The heuristics used by assistive technology will sometimes use the
    				text label if a programmatically associated label cannot be found.
    				The TU entry (which is the tooltip) of the
    				field dictionary is the programmatically
    				associated label (see Example
    				3 below and Table 220 in <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
              href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    				1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</loc>). Therefore, add a tooltip to each field to provide
    				a label that assistive technology can interpret.</p>

         <head>Placement rules</head>
         <p>The table below lists the placement rules governing where Adobe LiveCycle
    					positions labels by default. Note that these rules assume left-to-right
    					text directionality. If your form requires different positioning (e.g.,
    					to accommodate PDF documents in languages that use right-to-left text
    					directionality), see <emph>Repositioning form labels</emph> in Example
    					2 below. In general, authors should review label positioning to make

            <p>This example is shown with Adobe LiveCycle Designer. There are other software tools that perform similar functions. See the list of other software tools in <specref ref="pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications"/>.</p>
            <p>LiveCycle Designer provides several options for associating descriptive
    					text and labels with form elements. </p>
            <p>For sighted or low-vision users, it is important to properly position
    						the label adjacent to the control. For screen reader users, you should
    						also ensure that the label is programmatically associated with the
    						form control and that sufficient information is provided so that screen
    						reader users can readily complete and submit the form. </p>

               <head>Specifying accessible label text using the accessibility palette</head>
               <p>In LiveCycle Designer, create or import a form. Then: </p>
               <olist>
                  <item>
                     <p> Enable the palette by selecting Window &gt; Accessibility or by
    							pressing shift + F6. </p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p> The palette appears in LiveCycle Designer's right-hand panel. </p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p> Select an object in your form. The palette shows the object's
    								accessibility properties. </p>
                  </item>
               </olist>
               <p>

                  </image> 
               </p>
               <p>The label that a screen reader uses does not necessarily have to be
    							the same as the visual caption. In some cases, you may want to provide
    							more information about a form element's purpose. </p>
               <p>To specify what text should be announced by the screen reader for
    							a particular object, you can use the Accessibility Palette's Screen
    							Reader Precedence drop down list. Text is announced in the order shown
    							in the list: custom text, tool tip, caption, and name. </p>
               <p>Depending on the complexity and difficulty of your form, you must
    							decide which option best suits the requirements for your form. </p>
               <p>By default, a screen reader searches for an object's text in order
    							shown in the image. Once descriptive text has been found for a control,
    							the search stops. </p>
               <p>The image below shows an example of a text field with a visual caption
    							that might be unclear for screen reader users. One of the fields has
    							a caption of "Date" but screen reader users may want to know
    							the preferred date format (shown as screen text). So this text is provided
    							in the tooltip. Because a tooltip has a higher precedence than the
    							visual caption, the screen reader uses the tooltip. </p>

               <p>The placement of a caption, or label, is important because users expect

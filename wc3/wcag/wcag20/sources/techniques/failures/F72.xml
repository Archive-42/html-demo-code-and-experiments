   <short-name>Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using ASCII art without providing a text alternative</short-name>

   <description>
      <p>The objective of this failure condition is to avoid the use of <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
              href="asciiartdef"
              linktype="glossary">ASCII art</loc> when a text alternative is not provided. Although ASCII art is implemented as a character string, its meaning comes from the pattern of glyphs formed by a visual presentation of that string, not from the text itself. Therefore ASCII art is non-text content and requires a text alternative. Text alternatives, or links to them, should be placed near the ASCII art in order to be associated with it.</p>

         <head> ASCII Art chart without a text alternative </head>
         <description>
            <p>The following ASCII art chart lacks a text alternative and therefore does not meet Success Criterion 1.1.1. Note this failure example does in fact cause this page to fail, but you may <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#F72-related-techs">skip over the example</loc>.</p>

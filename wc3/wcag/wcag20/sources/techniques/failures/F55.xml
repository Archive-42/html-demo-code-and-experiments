   <description>
      <p>Content that normally receives focus when the content is accessed by keyboard may have this focus removed by scripting. This is sometimes done when designer considers the system focus indicator to be unsightly.  However, the system focus indicator is an important part of accessibility for keyboard users.  In addition, this practice removes focus from the content entirely, which means that the content can only be operated by a pointing device such as a mouse.</p>

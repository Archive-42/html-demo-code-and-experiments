   <description>
      <p>When content includes multiple formats, one or more user agents or plug-ins
                        are often needed in order to successfully present the content to users. For
                        example, a page that includes XHTML, SVG, SMIL and XForms may require a
                        browser to load as many as three different plug-ins in order for a user to
                        successfully interact with the content. Some plug-ins create a common
                        situation in which the keyboard focus can become "stuck" in a
                        plug-in, leaving a keyboard-only user with no way to return to the
                        other content. </p>

                                content with the keyboard. The user has to restart their browser in
                                order to regain control and navigate to a new page and is unable to
                                access any content that appears beyond the plug-in content. </p>

   <short-name>Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to complete change of main content through an

   <description>
      <p> This document describes a failure that occurs when the content in the main <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
              href="viewportdef"
              linktype="glossary">viewport</loc> viewport is automatically updated, and there there is no option for a user to disable this behavior. </p>
      <p>Two procedures are presented below to test for the existence of a failure against Success Criterion 3.2.5. Procedure 1 is the preferred procedure and assumes that content authors have access to the code that generates the viewport content.</p>
      <p>However there may be instances where this may not be possible (eg: in certain content management systems, application environments such as django or ruby-on-rails, or content generated through scripting languages such as AJAX or PHP that are generated by third parties.) To that end, the second procedure is supplied to allow testing in these instances. Note that timeframes are indicative only, and that any change after any amount of time should be treated as a failure if the test otherwise does not pass the other step evaluations. </p>

         <head/>
         <description>
            <p>A news site automatically refreshes itself to ensure that it has the
                                newest headlines. There is no option to disable this behavior. </p>

            <p>A slideshow fills the entire viewport and advances to the next slide
                                automatically. There is no stop button. </p>

            <p>A search engine automatically generates results and dynamically updates content based on user input. There is no option to disable this behavior.</p>

         <note>
            <p>One way to measure or estimate the amount of time in step 1 would be to check a web site's analytics to see how long the average user looks at the page.</p>
            <p>An example of step 6 would be a mechanism for turning off auto updates.</p>

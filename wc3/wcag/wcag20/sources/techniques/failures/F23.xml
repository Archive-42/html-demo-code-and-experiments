      <p> This describes a failure condition for Success Criteria involving sound. If sound does not
                        turn off automatically within 3 seconds and there is no way to turn the
                        sound off then Success Criterion 1.4.2 would not be met. Sounds that play over 3 seconds
                        when there is no mechanism to turn off the sound included in the content
                        would fall within this failure condition. </p>

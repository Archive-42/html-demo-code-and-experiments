   <short-name>Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to including scrolling content where movement is not essential to the activity without also including a mechanism to pause and restart the content</short-name>
   <applicability>
      <p>All technologies that support visual movement or scrolling.</p>

   <description>
      <p>In this failure technique, there is moving or scrolling content that cannot
                        be paused and resumed by users. In this case, some users with low vision or
                        cognitive disabilities will not be able to perceive the content.</p>

   <examples>
      <ulist>
         <item>
            <p>A page has a scrolling news ticker without a mechanism to pause it.
                                Some users are unable to read the scrolling content.</p>

               <p>Check that a mechanism is provided in the Web page or user agent
                                    to pause moving or scrolling content.</p>

            <item>
               <p>Use the pause mechanism to pause the moving or scrolling

            <item>
               <p>Check that the moving or scrolling has stopped and does not

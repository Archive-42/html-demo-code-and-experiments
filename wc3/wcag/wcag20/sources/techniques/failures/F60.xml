      <p>This document describes a failure that occurs when a new window is created in
                        response to a user filling in a text field for other than error reporting.

            <p> This is a deprecated example showing a failure: A user is filling in
                                his mailing address. When he fills in his postal code, a new window
                                opens containing advertisements for services available in his city.
                            </p>

            <p>This example is acceptable: A user is filling in his mailing address
                                in a form. When he fills in the postal code field, a script runs to
                                validate that it is a valid postal code. If the value is not valid,
                                a window opens with instructions on how to fill in the field. </p>

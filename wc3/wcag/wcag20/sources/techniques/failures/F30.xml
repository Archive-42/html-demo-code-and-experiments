   <description>
      <p> This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving text
                        alternatives. If the text in the "text alternative" cannot be used in place
                        of the non-text content without losing information or function then it fails
                        because it is not, in fact, an alternative to the non-text content. </p>

                                        location on images or pictures. </p>

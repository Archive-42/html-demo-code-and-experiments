   <short-name>Failure of Success Criterion 1.2.2 due to captions omitting some dialogue or important
                    sound effects</short-name>

   <description>
      <p> This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving captions. If
                        the "caption" does not include all of the dialogue (either verbatim or in
                        essence) as well as all important sounds then the 'Captions' are not real
                        captions. </p>
      <p> NOTE: Captions sometimes simplify the spoken text both to make it easier to
                        read and to avoid forcing the viewer to read at very high speed. This is
                        standard procedure and does not invalidate a caption. </p>

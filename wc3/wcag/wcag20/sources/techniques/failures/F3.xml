   <short-name>Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using CSS to include images that convey

   <description>
      <p> The CSS background-image property provides a way to include images in the
                        document with CSS without any reference in the HTML code. The CSS
                        background-image property was designed for decorative purposes and it is not
                        possible to associate text alternatives with images that are included via
                        CSS. Text alternatives are necessary for people who cannot see images that
                        convey important information. Therefore, it is a failure to use this
                        property to add images to convey important information. This failure would apply equally in a case where the background image was declared in the HTML style attribute, as well as in a case where the background image declaration was created dynamically in a client script (see example 3 below).</p>
      <note>
         <p>Embedding information into a background image can also cause problems for people who use alternate backgrounds in order to increase legibility and for users of high contrast mode in some operating systems. These users, would lose the information in the background image due to lack of any alternative text.</p>

            <p> In the following example, part of the content is contained in an
                                image that is presented by CSS alone. In this example, the image
                                TopRate.png is a 180 by 200 pixel image that contains the text,
                                "19.3% APR Typical Variable." </p>

            <p> A book distributor uses background images to provide icons against a
                                list of book titles to indicate whether they are new, limited,
                                in-stock, or out of stock. </p>
            <p>The CSS contains: </p>

            <p>Using the code from example 1, the same background image is declared in the HTML style attribute:</p>
            <codeblock xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<p id="bestinterest" style="background: transparent url(/images/TopRate.png) no-repeat top left;" >
Where else would you find a better interest rate?
<p>]]></codeblock>
            <p>In the following code, the background image declaration is created in a client script:</p>
            <codeblock xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[<script type="text/javascript">
var newP = document.createElement('p');
var newPText = document.createTextNode('Where else would you find a better interest rate?');
newP.appendChild(newPText);
newP.style.background = 'transparent url(/images/TopRate.png) no-repeat top left';
document.body.appendChild(newP);
</script> ]]></codeblock>

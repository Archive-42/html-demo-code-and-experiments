      <p>The objective of this technique is to demonstrate using device independent events to change a decorative image in response to a mouse or focus event. Use the <code><![CDATA[onmouseover]]></code> and onmouseout events to change a decorative image when the mouse moves on top of or away from an element on the page. Also, use the <code><![CDATA[onfocus]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[onblur]]></code> events to change the image when the element receives and loses focus.</p>
      <p>The example below has a decorative image in front of an anchor element. When the user mouses over the anchor tag, the decorative image in front of the anchor is changed. When the mouse moves off of the anchor, the image is changed back to its original version. The same image change effect occurs when the user gives keyboard focus to the anchor element. When focus is received the image changes, when focus is lost the image is changed back. This is accomplished by attaching <code><![CDATA[onmouseover]]></code>, <code><![CDATA[onmouseout]]></code>, <code><![CDATA[onfocus]]></code> and <code><![CDATA[onblur]]></code> event handlers to the anchor element. The event handler is a JavaScript function called updateImage(), which changes the src attribute of the image. The updateImage() is called in response to the onmouseover, onmouseout, onfocus, and onblur events.</p>
      <p>Each image is given a unique id. This unique id is passed to updateImage() along with a boolean value indicating which image is to be used: <code><![CDATA[updateImage(imgId, isOver);]]></code>. The boolean value of true is passed when the mouse is over the anchor element or it has focus. A false value is passed when the mouse moves off of the anchor element or it loses focus. The updateImage() function uses the image id to load the image and then changes the src attribue based on the boolean value. Note that since the image is for decorative purposes, it has a null alt attribute. </p>
      <note>
         <p>It is best to use images that are similar in size and to specify the height and width attributes on the image element. This will prevent any changes to the layout of the page when the image is updated. This example uses images which are identical in size. </p>

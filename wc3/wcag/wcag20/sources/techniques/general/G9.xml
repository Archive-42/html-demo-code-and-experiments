      <p>The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able
            to access real-time synchronized media broadcasts. It is more difficult to create
            accurate real-time captions because there is little time to correct mistakes
            or to listen a second time or consult someone to be sure the words are
            accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase
            information if it is flowing too quickly.</p>
      <p>Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid
            typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to
            speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their
            speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the
            future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be
            possible.</p>

   <examples>
       <eg-group>
		   <p>A television studio uses a real-time captioning service
                to create captions for its evening news online.</p>
       </eg-group>
       <eg-group>
		   <p>A user watches an online seminar on their mobile device, including captioning provided through the use of Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART). The captions provided also benefit in-person participants who need captioning and can view the information on their own device.</p>

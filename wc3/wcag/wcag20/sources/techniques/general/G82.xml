      <p>The purpose of this technique is to provide useful information via the text
            alternative even if the full function of the non-text content cannot be
            provided.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, a text alternative cannot serve the same purpose as the original
            non-text content (for example an applet meant to develop two dimensional
            rapid targeting skills and eye hand coordination.) In these cases this
            technique is used. With this technique a description of the purpose of the
            non-text content is provided.</p>

                  <p>An eye-hand coordination development applet has the

                    edges to control a remote camera and a slider in the middle
                    for zooming has the following text alternative "Control for

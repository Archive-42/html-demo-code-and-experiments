      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism for people who cannot complete tasks within a specified time limit to turn off the time limit.</p>
      <p>It is essential that the mechanism for turning off the time limit can be completed without a time limit itself and before the time limit for the page expires. To do this - the mechanism should be available at or near the top of the page so that it can be found and activated quickly by people with a wide range of disabilities.</p>

      <ulist>
         <item>
            <p>A page has a listing of news headlines that automatically update every minute. At the top of the page is a link that turns off the updating.</p>

               <p>Check that there is a mechanism to turn off any time limits near the top of the page.</p>

            <item>
               <p>Verify that the time limit for the page is long enough that a user can easily navigate to the mechanism even if they are 10 times slower than most users.</p>

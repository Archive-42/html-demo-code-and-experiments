   <short-name>Using markup features to expose the name and role, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes</short-name>
   <applicability>
      <p>Markup technologies where it is possible to expose the name and role, allow
            user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of
            changes.</p>

   <description>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to allow assistive technology to
            understand Web content so that it can convey equivalent information to the
            user through an alternate user interface and allow them to operate controls
            through the AT.</p>
      <p>This technique involves using standard, documented and supported features to
            expose these properties to AT. It relies on the fact that these standard
            controls in standard browsers meet the requirements.</p>
      <p>For HTML these assumptions are good. They may also be appropriate for some
            other technologies.</p>
      <p>Even when the components support accessibility, it is essential that some
            information be provided by the author. For example, a control may have the
            ability to provide a name but the author still has to provide the name. The
            role attribute however may already be provided since it is a standard
            component with a fixed role.</p>

      <eg-group>
         <description>
            <p>Example 1: A Web page written in HTML or XHTML uses standard form
                controls, and identifies the form control using the title attribute.
                The user agent makes information about these controls, including the
                name, available to assistive technology through the DOM and through
                a platform-specific Accessibility API.</p>

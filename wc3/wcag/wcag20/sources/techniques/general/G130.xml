      <p>The objective of this technique is to make section headings within Web content descriptive. Descriptive headings and titles (see <loc xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
              href="G88"
              linktype="techniques">Providing descriptive titles for Web pages</loc>) work together to give users an overview of the content and its organization. Descriptive headings identify sections of the content in relation both to the Web page as a whole and to other sections of the same Web page.</p>
      <p>Descriptive headings help users find specific content and orient themselves within the Web page.</p>
      <p>Authors may also want to consider putting the most important information at the beginning of each heading. This helps users â€œskim" the headings to locate the specific content they need, and is especially helpful when browsers or assistive technology allow navigation from heading to heading.</p>

         <description>
            <p>An HTML page that describes the range of tasks for disaster preparation may have the following headings:</p>
         </description>
         <code role="html401"><![CDATA[
              <h1>Disaster preparation</h1>
                <h2>Flood preparation</h2>
                <h2>Fire preparation</h2>
            ]]></code>
         <description>
            <p>Note that the level 2 headings have the distinguishing information at the beginning (ie, instead of "Preparation for floods", "Preparation for fires", etc).</p>

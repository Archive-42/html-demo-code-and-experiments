   <description>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a warning before automatically
            opening a new window or tab. Opening new windows automatically when
            a link is activated can be disorienting for people who have difficulty
            perceiving visual content, and for some people with cognitive disabilities,
            if they are not warned in advance. Providing a warning allows the user
            to decide it they want to leave the current window, and the warning
            will help them find their way back, if they do decide they would like
            to go to the new window. It will help them understand that the "back" button
            will not work and that they have to return to the last window they
            had open, in order to find their previous location.</p>

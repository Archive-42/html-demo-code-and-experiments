      <p>The purpose of this technique is to allow authors to play a sound on their
            Web page but avoid the problem of users not being able to use their screen
            readers due to interference by the content sound. It also allows the author
            to avoid putting controls on the Web page to control the sound - and the problem
            faced by users with screen readers in finding the control (when unable
            to hear their screen reader).</p>
      <p>The technique is simple. The sound plays for 3 or less seconds and stops
            automatically.</p>

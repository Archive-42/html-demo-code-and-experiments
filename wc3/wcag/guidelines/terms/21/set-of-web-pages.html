   <p>collection of <a>web pages</a> that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization
   </p>
   
   <p class="example">Examples include a publication which is split across multiple Web pages, where each page contains
      one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically
      a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the
      full set of pages.

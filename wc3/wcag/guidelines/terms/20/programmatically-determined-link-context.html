<dt><dfn>programmatically determined link context</dfn></dt>
<dd>
   
   <p>additional information that can be <a>programmatically determined</a> from <a>relationships</a> with a link, combined with the link text, and presented to users in different modalities
   </p>
   
   <p class="example">In HTML, information that is programmatically determinable from a link in English
      includes text that is in the same paragraph, list, or table cell as the link or in
      a table header cell that is associated with the table cell that contains the link.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Since screen readers interpret punctuation, they can also provide the context from
      the current sentence, when the focus is on a link in that sentence.

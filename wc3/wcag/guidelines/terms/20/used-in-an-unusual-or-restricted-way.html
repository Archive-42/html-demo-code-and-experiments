   <p class="example">The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts
      than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition
      can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific
      way in WCAG 2.1, so a definition is supplied in the glossary.

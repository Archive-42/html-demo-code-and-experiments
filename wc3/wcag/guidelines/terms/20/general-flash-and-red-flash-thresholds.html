<dt><dfn>general flash and red flash thresholds</dfn></dt>
<dd>
   
   <p>a <a>flash</a> or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content <strong>passes</strong>) if any of the following are true:
   </p>
   
   <ol>
      
      <li>there are no more than three <strong>general flashes</strong> and / or no more than three <strong>red flashes</strong> within any one-second period; or
      </li>
      
      <li>the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total
         of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10
         degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance
      </li>
      
   </ol>
   
   <p>where:</p>
   
   <ul>
      
      <li>A <strong>general flash</strong> is defined as a pair of opposing changes in <a>relative luminance</a> of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of
         the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase
         followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and
      </li>
      
      <li>A <strong>red flash</strong> is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red
      </li>
      
   </ul>
   
   <p><em>Exception:</em> Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating
      checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical
      viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">For general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on
      the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide
      a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing
      distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays
      showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is
      lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for
      red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or
      relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists
      of two opposing transitions.
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">The current working definition in the field for <strong>"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"</strong> is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+ G + B) &gt;=
      0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is &gt; 20 (negative values of (R-G-B)x320
      are set to zero) for both transitions. R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified
      in “relative luminance” definition. [[HARDING-BINNIE]]
   </p>
   
   <p class="note">Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,
      no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal
      to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).

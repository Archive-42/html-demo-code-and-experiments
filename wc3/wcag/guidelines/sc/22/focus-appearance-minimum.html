    <h4>Focus Appearance (Minimum)</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>When <a>user interface components</a> receive keyboard focus, an area of the focus indicator meets the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The area is either:
        <ul>
            <li>at least as large as the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>perimeter</a> of the unfocused component, or</li>
            <li>at least as large as the area of a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a <a>minimum bounding box</a> of the unfocused component, and no part of the area is thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The area has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors when the component is focused and it is not focused.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> Where the area is adjacent to the component, it has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the component or a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, the item with focus is not entirely hidden by author-created content.</p>

    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
    <p class="note">If the component has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, or the size of the component is not available, the minimum area can be taken from the visible boundary.</p>
    <p class="ednote">The working group is interested in feedback about the minimum area metric, and if there are unusual scenarios where visible indicators are caught by the wording.</p>

    <p>All functionality that uses a <a>dragging movement</a> for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is <a>essential</a>.</p>
    <p class="note">This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>
    <p class="ednote">Is there an assistive technology that helps for people with mobility impairments? The group would like feedback on the frontier between AT &amp; author responsibility.</p>

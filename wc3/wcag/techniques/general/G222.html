			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure that controls are visible without requiring the user hover with the mouse or another pointer device or move the keyboard focus to the control.  This is important when the user needs the control to progress or complete a process. Ensuring users can see the controls they need prevents users from having to search for controls and remember where they are located. This improves success for individuals with cognitive and learning disabilities and memory impairments.</p>
			<p>To meet this technique use controls that are visible without onmouseover or onfocus events. </p>
			<p>Some pages may appear cluttered when the same control is repeated in multiple places on the page. Often in these cases, the control is not needed to progress but is functioning as a shortcut through the process. If the control is provided in a later step when it is needed to progress, then these shortcuts do not need to be displayed.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Replying to an Email</h3>
				<p>Replying to an email involves opening an inbox, opening the email, hitting reply, writing an email and hitting send. When the email is open, the Reply button is clearly visible at the top.  When the editable email opens, a send button is visible at the top. The reply button is also displayed when the email is hovered over in the inbox, but since it is available later in the process when it is needed to progress, the hover approach is OK. </p>

		<section id="example-2">
				<h3>Login Form</h3>
				<p>A login form requires the user complete a name and two matching passwords that meet certain criteria. When the information is completed, the Submit button becomes visible. </p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>For controls that progress or complete a process:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Verify that the controls are visible at the time they are needed without requiring pointer hover or keyboard focus.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Note: Where a page has multiple page variations (i.e., in a responsive design) controls should be tested in each variation. </p>

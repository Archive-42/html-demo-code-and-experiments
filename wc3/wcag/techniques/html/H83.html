      <p>The objective of this technique is to avoid confusion that may be caused by the appearance of new windows that were not requested by the user. Suddenly opening new windows can disorient users or be missed completely by some. In HTML5, HTML 4.01 Transitional, and XHTML 1.0 Transitional, the <code class="att">target</code> attribute can be used to open a new window, instead of automatic pop-ups. (The <code class="att">target</code> attribute is deleted from HTML 4.01 Strict and XHTML 1.0 Strict.) Note that not using the <code class="att">target</code> allows the user to decide whether a new window should be opened or not. Use of the <code class="att">target</code> attribute provides an unambiguously machine-readable indication that a new window will open. User agents can inform the user, and can also be configured not to open the new window. For those not using assistive technology, the indication would also be available from the link text.</p>

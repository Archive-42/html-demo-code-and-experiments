   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The objective of this technique is to specify the language of a passage,
    				phrase, or word using the /Lang entry to provide information in the
    				PDF document that user agents need to present text and other linguistic
    				content correctly. This is normally accomplished using a tool for authoring
    				PDF. </p>
      <p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render
    				text more accurately when the language is identified. Screen readers
    				can load the correct pronunciation rules.     				As a result, users with disabilities are better able to understand
    				the content. </p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>This technique can be used to set the default
    				language for the entire document if the entire document is contained
    				in the container or tag. In this case, this technique would apply to
    				Success Criterion 3.1.1. </p>

    						the selection. As needed, drag the document content tag for the selected
    						text into position between the other two tags, so that the text reads
    						in the proper order. All three tags must also be at the same level
    						beneath their parent tag. Drag them into place if they are not. </p>

            <li>
               <p>Verify that the language of a passage, phrase, or word that differs
    					from the language of the surrounding text is correctly specified
    					by a /Lang entry on an enclosing tag or container:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li> Read the PDF document with a screen reader that supports the language of the phrase and the language of the surrounding text, listening to hear
    						that the text is read in the correct natural language. </li>
                  <li>Using a PDF editor, select the word or phrase that is in the different language and check that the language is set correctly. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool which is capable of showing the /Lang entry value
    								to open the PDF document and view the language settings. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility
    									API and verify that the language for the passage or phrase is
    									set correctly. </li>

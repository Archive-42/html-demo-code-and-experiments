      <p>Scanned PDF documents</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The intent of this technique is to ensure that visually rendered text
    				is presented in such a manner that it can be perceived without its
    				visual presentation interfering with its readability. </p>
      <p>A document that consists of scanned images of text is inherently inaccessible
    				because the content of the document is images, not searchable text.
    				Assistive technologies cannot read or extract the words; users cannot
    				select, edit, resize, or reflow text nor can they change text and background
    				colors; and authors cannot manipulate the PDF for accessibility. </p>
      <p>For these reasons, authors should use actual text rather than images
    				of text, using an authoring tool such as Microsoft Word or Oracle Open
    				Office to author and convert content to PDF. </p>
      <p>If authors do not have access to the source file and authoring tool,
    				scanned images of text can be converted to PDF using optical character
    				recognition (OCR). Adobe Acrobat Pro can then be used to create accessible
    				text. </p>

      <section class="example">
         <h3>Generating actual text rather than images of text using
    					Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro</h3>
         
            <p>This example is shown with Adobe Acrobat Pro. There are other software tools that perform similar functions. See the list of other software tools in <a href="#pdf_notes_acc-sup_files_applications"></a>.</p>
            <p>This example uses a simple one-page scanned image of text. To ensure
    						that actual text is stored in the document, perform the following steps: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> Scan the document using as high a resolution as possible to improve
    						the OCR performance. </li>
               <li> Load the scanned document in Acrobat Pro. Select Document &gt; OCR
    						Text Recognition &gt; Recognize Text Using OCR... </li>
               <li> In the next dialog, select the All Pages radio button under Pages
    								(or Current Page if you are converting only one page), and then select
    								OK. </li>
               <li> Under the Settings list, select Edit. In the next dialog, select
    									Formatted Text and Graphics in the PDF Output Style drop-down list.
    									This is important for ensuring accessibility. </li>
               <li> Depending on the resolution and how clear the text was, OCR converts
    										images of words and characters to actual text. Text that Acrobat
    										Pro does not recognize is listed as an "OCR suspect," or
    										text element that Acrobat suspects was not recognized correctly. </li>
               <li> To fix the suspects, choose Document &gt; OCR Text Recognition   &gt; Find
    											First OCR Suspect. Acrobat Pro presents each suspect one at a time,
    											which can be corrected using Acrobat Pro touchup tools. </li>
               <li> Run Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add Tags to Document </li>
               <li> Test for accessibility: Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
    						Check... </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="note">
               <p>Alternatively, you can use Document &gt; OCR
    						Text Recognition &gt; Find All OCR Suspects to display all OCR suspects
    						at the same time for faster editing. </p>
            </div>
            <p>The following image shows a scanned one-page document in Adobe Acrobat
    						Pro. </p>
            <figure id="figure-acrobat-scanned-image">
               <img src="img/ocr1.jpg" />
                  
                  <figcaption>A scanned page in Acrobat Pro showing soup recipes.</figcaption> 
                
            </figure>
            <p>The next image shows the converted content after adding tags to the
    						document. It will probably be necessary to use the TouchUp Reading
    						Order tool and the Tags panel to tag the content properly for the intended
    						final document. For this example, the image of the spiral book binding
    						was tagged in the conversion. The TouchUp Reading Order tool was used
    						to hide the image as a background (decorative) image (see <a href="#PDF4"></a>). The recipe
    						titles were tagged as first level headers. </p>
            <figure id="figure-acrobat-converted-scanned">
               <img src="img/ocr3.jpg" />
                  
                  <figcaption>A tagged converted page in Acrobat Pro showing soup recipes. The name of each soup is a first level header. The image of the spiral book binding was hidden as a decorative image.</figcaption>
                
            </figure>
            <p>Note: Acrobat Pro may automatically add tags when the file is run
    					through OCR. </p>

         <ol>
            <li>
               <p> For each page converted to text using OCR, ensure that the resulting
    					PDF has been converted correctly, using one of the following ways:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li> Read the PDF document with a screen reader or a tool that reads aloud, listening to hear that all text is read correctly
    						and in the correct reading order. </li>
                  <li> Save the document as text and check that the converted text
    							is complete and in the correct reading order. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool that is capable of showing the converted content
    								to open the PDF document and verify that all text was converted
    								and is in the correct reading order. </li>
                  <li> Use a tool that exposes the document through the accessibility
    									API and verify that all text was converted and is in the correct
    									reading order. </li>
               </ul>
            </li>

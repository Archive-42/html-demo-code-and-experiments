      <p>The objective of this technique is to notify the user when a field
    				that must be completed has not been completed in a PDF form. Required
    				fields are implemented using the /Ff entry in the form field's dictionary
    				(see Table 220 in Section 12.7 (Interactive Forms) of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf">PDF
    					1.7 (ISO 32000-1)</a>. This is normally accomplished using a tool for
    				authoring PDF. </p>
      <p>If errors are found, an alert dialog describes the nature of the error
    				in text. This may be accomplished through scripting created by the
    				author (see, for example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/client-side-script/SCR18">SCR18:
    					Providing client-side validation and alert</a>). User agents, such
    				as Adobe Acrobat Pro and LiveCycle, can provide automatic alerts (as
    				described in the examples below). </p>
      <p>
         <em>Note</em>: once the user dismisses the alert dialog, it
    				may be helpful if the script positions the keyboard focus on the field
    				where the error occurred, although some users may expect the focus
    				to remain on the last control focused prior to the alert appearing.
    				Authors should exercise care to ensure that any movement of the focus
    				will be expected. For example, if the alert announces a missing required
    				phone number, positioning the focus on the phone number field when
    				the alert is dismissed can be regarded as helpful and expected. In
    				some cases, however, this may not be possible. If multiple input errors
    				occur on the page, another approach must be taken to error reporting. 
(See, for example, the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html">Adobe scripting resources.</a>) </p>
      <p>Ensuring that users are aware an error has occurred, can determine
    				what is wrong, and can correct it are keys to software usability and
    				accessibility. Meeting this objective helps ensure that all users can
    				complete transactions with ease and confidence. </p>
   	<section id="PDF5_labels">
         <h4> Labels for required form controls </h4>
         <p>It is also important that users are aware that an error <em>may</em> occur.
    				You can incorporate this information in labels; for example,   "Date
    				(required)" or the use of a red asterisk to indicate required
    				fields. (Make sure that a legend appears on each form with required
    				fields, e.g., "* = required field".) See <a href="#PDF10"></a>. </p>

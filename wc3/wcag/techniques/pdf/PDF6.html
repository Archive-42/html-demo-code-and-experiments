      <p>Tagged PDF documents with tables</p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this technique is to show how tables in PDF documents
    				can be marked up so that they are recognized by assistive technology.
    				This is typically accomplished by using a tool for authoring PDF. </p>
      <p>Tabular information must be presented in a way that preserves relationships
    				within the information even when users cannot see the table or the
    				presentation format is changed. Information is considered tabular when
    				logical relationships among text, numbers, images, or other data exist
    				in two dimensions (vertical and horizontal). These relationships are
    				represented in columns and rows, and the columns and rows must be recognizable
    				in order for the logical relationships to be perceived. </p>
      <p>Tagged tables can be created using the Add Tags to Document feature
    				in Adobe Acrobat, using the Object Library in Adobe LiveCycle, or converting
    				tables to PDF from a third-party application, such as Microsoft Word.
    				However, the resulting tables may not be tagged correctly and you should
    				ensure that table tagging issues are resolved. </p>
      <p>Within PDF documents, a table uses the following structure types for
    				table elements: </p>
      <ul>
         <li> A table element (<em>Table</em>). </li>
         <li> One or more table row elements(<em>TR</em>) which define each
    				row of table cells as immediate children of the <em>Table</em> element. </li>
         <li> One or more table header elements (<em>TH</em>) or table data
    					elements (<em>TD</em>) as the immediate children of each table row
    					element. </li>
         <li> Cells that span two or more rows or columns should use the <em>RowSpan</em> or <em>ColSpan</em> attribute. </li>
         <li> For tables that contain blank cells, you may need to add empty <em>TD</em> cells
    						so that each row or column has the same number of cells. </li>
      </ul>

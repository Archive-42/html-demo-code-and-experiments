      <p> Applies to all technologies that support an accessibility API. </p>
   </section><section id="description"><h2>Description</h2>
      <p> When standard controls from accessible technologies are used, they usually are programmed in a way that uses and supports the accessibility API. If custom controls are created, however, then it is up to the programmer to be sure that the newly created control supports the accessibility API. If this is not done, then assistive technologies will not be able to understand what the control is or how to operate it or may not even know of its existence.</p>
      <div class="note">
         <p>For technologies that support it, WAI-ARIA can be used to expose a custom control's role, name, value, states, and properties via the accessibility API for the technology.</p>

      <section class="example">
         
            <p>A music player is designed with custom controls that look like
                                musical notes that are stretched for volume, tone etc. The
                                programmer does not make the new control support the Accessibility
                                API. As a result - the controls cannot be identified or controlled
                                from AT. </p>

      <section class="procedure"><h3>Procedure</h3>
         <ol>
            <li> Using the accessibility checker for the technology (or if
                                    that is not available, inspect the code or test with an
                                    assistive technology), check the controls to see if they support
                                    the accessibility API. </li>

    <div class="scope">
      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>Near-field communication (NFC) is a form of short range wireless
      communication in which NFC devices such as mobile phones can communicate
      with each other over a typical distance of 4cm or less. NFC allows for two
      way communication.
      The <a href="http://www.nfc-forum.org/home/">NFC Forum</a>
      defines base standards for how smart cards are emulated by NFC devices and
      NFC Forum tags are formatted and the protocols for communicating between
      devices. There are three modes of operation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>read/write mode - the NFC device can read or write records, each of
        which has a type. There are currently several defined record types (Text,
        URI, Smart Poster, etc.). Records can be set to read-only, and protected
        through encryption and digital signatures.</li>

        <li>peer to peer mode - where two NFC devices exchange data, for
        example, data for setting up WiFi access, or data representing a
        business card.</li>

        <li>card emulation mode - where an NFC device emulates a smart card,
        e.g. allowing an NFC enabled phone to be used for contactless ticketing
        and payment applications. Emulated cards may have limited storage
        capabilities, e.g. the MiFare Classic 1K with 1024 bytes of data storage
        split across 16 sectors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The main benefit of NFC is the speed and simplicity of operation for
      end users. Touch a card to a reader to pay for ride on the metro. Touch
      an NFC phone to a tag on a poster to view the website for the associated
      event. Touch two NFC phones together to exchange business cards.</p>

      <p>In some cases no set up is needed as the card's record type is
      recognized by the NFC device's operating system, which automatically
      launches the appropriate application, such as the web browser. In other
      cases, as in peer to peer mode, the device will first need to run the
      corresponding application, which may involve asking the user to select
      what information to share.</p>

      <p>The Web Near Field Communication Working Group will define
      an API for Web page scripts to use the NFC data exchange format and APDUs,
      enabling a range of use cases for reading, writing, emulating cards and
      data exchange with peer NFC devices. Further background information can be
      found on the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/wiki/Near_field_communications_(NFC)">NFC
      Wiki</a>.</p>

      <!--
      <h3>Compatibility and Deployment Expectation</h3>

      <p>The Web NFC API will be designed to be compatible with current NFC
      specifications. It is expected that the NFC API will be widely supported
      on web run-times for NFC enabled devices such as smart phones.</p>
      -->

      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
      <p>The goal is to provide a Web NFC API that satisfies the most important
      use cases for NFC from Web pages. We believe that means that the API will
      not expose full, low level NFC functionality, but rather a higher level
      subset that is safe for Web pages, protects user privacy, and doesn't
      annoy users with unnecessary or complex permission requests.</p>

      <p>The scope of the Web Near Field Communications Working Group is limited
      to the development of APIs for Web page scripts to perform the following
      operations with NFC devices:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reading NDEF messages</li>
        <li>Writing NDEF messages</li>
        <li>Setting NFC tags to read-only</li>
        <li>Peer to peer exchange of NDEF messages between NFC devices</li>
        <li>Optionally, manual connection for various technologies, e.g. NFC-A
          and NFC-F
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, initiation of NFC Card emulation mode for NFC devices,
          to allow the use of a device for payments or for unlocking electronic
          door locks.
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, initiation of handover mode to Bluetooth or WiFi
          technology.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The APIs will be designed to permit execution in the
      Web browser context, using the security model of the Web.
                The very short range of NFC devices requires users
      to make a conscious decision to put one of the devices into the
      appropriate mode and to bring the devices physically together, and this
      should enable a simpler security model that minimizes the need for
      applications to ask for explicit user permission.
      The need for direct user involvement under circumstances will need
      to be explored.</p>

      <p>The Working Group will explore permission models that recognize the
      special role of the frontmost, foreground tab when NFC devices are brought
      into close proximity by the user. The Working Group will also explore the
      possibility of sites registering with the user agent for particular types
      of messages. When multiple registrations are made for a particular type
      of message, a chooser is shown to the user to select among sites to handle
      the available message.
      Considerations like these could simplify user interactions for granting
      permissions while preserving privacy and security.
      However, answering “yes” to a security question must not enable a page to
      overwrite a writable tag in a way the user did not expect.  Nor can it
      mean that a website can initiate a P2P communication with an NFC device
      which can have effects that the user did not intend.  The Working Group
      may consider both an API for use by an untrusted website, as well as an
      enhanced API available to a Website is considered trusted. </p>

      <p>The WG will consider requiring that User Agents implement the Web NFC
      API to be HTTPS-only.  The WG will consider requiring that for riskier
      API's that the User Agent knows which user is logged into the User Agent
      and knows what types of permissions that user is allowed to set, and the
      user has agreed to allowing a risky or experimental API for a particular
      trusted website.  The identity of the user would be known by the User
      Agent (but not the web page), to know what is permitted for use by that
      Web site.  The Web site is known through use of HTTPS so some APIs could
      be restricted to use by particular users and only by known, trusted
      websites.  The Working Group could also consider use of some APIs only
      for sites in the local network (if permitted by the user).  For example,
      where a device in the local network offers a web page (using https), the
      user could grant that web page permissions beyond what normally is allowed
      for random web pages.  That would allow for a set of APIs, one safe for
      any website and then perhaps others that require higher levels of trust
      and permission.</p>

      <!--p>It is recommended that the NDEF messages participating in interaction
      with web pages, are linked to the client web page origin, in order that
      the browser security model could be used by implementations.</p-->

      <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
      <p>The Working Group will not define underlying protocols or low level
      access APIs, but rather a Web API that provides a suitable abstraction
      for Web pages, with implementations using the underlying platform for NFC
      functionality.</p>

      <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

      <p>To advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected
      to have two independent implementations of all features defined in the
      specification</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

      <p>The Working Group will develop specifications for one or more W3C
      Recommendations covering the scoped functionality.</p>

      <p>This Working Group’s specifications have no direct dependencies on
      any other developing specification other than the  Web Applications
      Working Group’s Web IDL specification, which many W3C specs depend upon.
      However, several other groups would provide valuable feedback and they
      will be asked to review drafts.</p>

      <h3>W3C Groups</h3>

      <p>This Working Group expects to ask the following W3C Working Groups for
      reviews of deliverables, and where appropriate to liaise on potential

    <div class="participation">
      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

      <p>To be successful, the Web Near Field Communications Working Group is
      expected to have 8 or more active participants for its duration, with at
      least one major Web Browser implementer.</p>

      <p>If an extended period of time passes without two (2) independent
      implementers in the Working Group, the Working Group will move the
      unfinished specification  to a Community Group.</p>

      <p>Effective participation in the Working Group is expected to consume one
      work day per week for each participant; and up to two days per week for
      editors. The Web Near Field Communications Working Group will allocate
      also the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each
      specification.</p>

      <p>The Working Group welcomes participation from representatives of W3C
      Member organizations. To enable a broad spectrum of input, the group also
      anticipates the active participation of individuals as W3C Invited
      Experts (read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/invexp.html">policy
      for approval of Invited Experts</a>). Participation from W3C Members and
      non-Members alike will help ensure the goals of this charter are
      effectively addressed. Invited Experts in this group are not granted
      access to Member-only information.</p>

      <p>Participants are reminded of the <a href=
      "/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good Standing
      requirements</a> of the W3C Process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="communication">
      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

      <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list
      public-nfc@w3.org
      (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-nfc/">archive</a>).
      Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications.</p>

      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>As explained in the W3C Process Document (<a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
      3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus
      and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an editor or
      other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
      discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus
      emerges with little formal voting being required. However, if a decision
      is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after
      careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs should
      put a question out for voting within the group (allowing for remote
      asynchronous participation—using, for example, email and/or web-based
      survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The
      matter should then be considered resolved unless and until new
      information becomes available.</p>

      <p>Asynchronous decisions that are attained through the mailing list,
      possibly using a “Call for Consensus” process are preferred, but
      synchronous decisions made during a teleconference or a face-to-face
      meeting are valid provided that the topic they address was clearly
      outlined in a public agenda posted one week earlier so that
      non-participating parties have a chance to voice their views ahead of
      time.</p>

      <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section 3.4,
      Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures
      beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>

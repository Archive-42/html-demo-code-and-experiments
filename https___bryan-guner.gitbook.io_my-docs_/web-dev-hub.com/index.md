## [How to Write Website Content¬†](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/10/12/how-to-write-website-content/)

## What Is Web Copy?

Website copy usually refers to the main body of text on your website, intended to sell your product or service. It‚Äôs the words that guide your visitors through the site, explain your brand concept, and tell people about your services. Typically, these main pages include the Homepage, About Us, Service Page, and FAQ.

So what makes good website content?

**Your web copy should match the search intent of your potential customers.¬†**You want to help them solve their problem and take action ‚Äî¬†make a purchase, subscribe to your blog, or join your mailing list.

## How to Write Website Content¬†

We‚Äôve divided our recommendations into three groups: Pre-Writing Tips, Writing Tips, and Post-Writing Tips.

![](https://static.semrush.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1010/blog/uploads/media/0d/13/0d13a4faae59b4a0c34667182e9f3bcf/2x_nfographic_Website_Copy_101_How_To_Write_Website_Content_1.png)

### Pre-Writing Tips

Your content‚Äôs foundation should be laid before you start writing, and here are three key points to keep in mind.

#### Tip \#1:¬†Define Your Purpose

The single most important thing for any writer of copy is to understand its purpose. Knowing your end goal from the outset helps you craft the perfect piece of content and an ideal call-to-action statement (I‚Äôll talk more about CTAs in¬†[Writing Tips](https://www.semrush.com/blog/14-tips-for-writing-awesome-website-content/#header8)).

The objective of the copy supports the goals of the business. So, find your answers to the questions about it:

- Is the website intended to sell a product or a service?
- Is it focused on building traffic with the intention of increasing advertising revenue or sponsorships?
- Is it aimed at attracting new clients and generating¬†leads?
- Is the main objective to attract subscribers or build a community?

#### Tip \#2: Understand Your Target Audience

Let‚Äôs say selling is your primary goal. You can determine the best methods of selling only by knowing your audience. The more you know about your prospects, the better you can convert them into paying customers.

To write copy that hooks your potential customers, you need to get into their mindset:

- Who are the people coming to your site?
- What kinds of problems do they want to solve?
- What search terms would they type into a search bar?

If you can learn to write in the ways in which your visitors speak or search, you can start building up a relationship of trust.¬†And if you answer their specific question, they may become your loyal audience and clients.

#### Tip \#3:¬†Know Your Competitors

It‚Äôs also a good move to do some research on the websites of your competitors.

It‚Äôs likely that visitors to your website will also be considering the competition, so you need to make a strategic decision about whether to offer similar content or branch out and offer something different. Research can be an excellent way to spot trends among competitors and get ahead of the game.

The easiest way to do this is simply to search your main product, service, or topic in Google, discover which sites are ranking, and investigate what they are doing:

- What is the primary service they offer?
- What type of content do they use on their main pages ‚Äî¬†success stories, videos, statistics?
- What audience do they target?

**Lily Ray,**¬†[@lilyraynyc](https://twitter.com/Whigsy):

‚ÄúLook at the search results to determine how feasible it even is to rank, how we should structure our content, tone/sentiment analysis, what featured/rich snippets we can earn, and whether to focus on informational and/or transactional content.‚Äù

**Kyle Whigham,**¬†[@Whigsy](https://twitter.com/lilyraynyc):

‚ÄúIdentify which pieces of content are driving engagement, be it traffic (estimated of course), likes, shares, etc. Social signals send a clear message in terms of what your shared audience finds valuable and interesting. Use those pages and compare page titles, meta descriptions, and type of content (long/short form, video content, etc.).‚Äù

### Writing Tips

Writing copy that resonates requires hard work, good writing skills, and anticipation of visitors‚Äô questions. Here are nine tips to help you engage your audience and convert them to customers.

#### Tip \#4:¬†Hook Your Readers from the First Line

As I said at the beginning, you might have just 15 seconds to capture your reader‚Äôs interest. If you manage this, your new challenge is to get the reader to stay on the site.

You can start your copy with some exciting data, a one-sentence story, or a question. Make sure people are hungry for more content after reading the introduction.

![](https://static.semrush.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1010/blog/uploads/media/8f/bb/8fbbee775bce0f92e5de70151c43df02/Screenshot%202020-11-05%20at%2019.56.18.png)

#### Tip \#5:¬†Make Your Copy Scannable

The layout is important too. Most people skim read, so to ensure that the text is easily scannable, you should include headers, bulleted and numbered lists, descriptive subheadings, and white space between paragraphs.

![](https://static.semrush.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1010/blog/uploads/media/9f/2c/9f2c6b7f2f71a0d8190fe68488ccd494/Screenshot%202020-10-29%20at%2023.07.19.png)

#### Tip \#6:¬†Help Readers Navigate

Remember that there are multiple routes through which audiences find web content. It could be from a post shared on social media, via links on other websites, via a marketing email, or through a search engine results page.

People who receive your message might not be that familiar with your brand. They will be grateful if you make it clear what your business offers and put relevant links for further details in your copy.

It‚Äôs also a good idea to post links to your social media accounts prominently to create a connection between your brand and visitors. They may leave the site, but remain your social media subscriber and return to the site.

#### Tip \#7:¬†Talk to Readers as You Would a Friend

Create a bond between your brand and the client using such techniques as:

- Active voice: use sentence structure like ‚ÄúYou can order our services‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúOur services can be ordered.‚Äù The passive voice is relevant when you want to sound more formal; in other cases, use the active voice to sound¬†more personal.
- Direct addressing: use ‚Äúyou‚Äù to address your reader, ‚Äúwe‚Äù to speak from the point of view of a company, and ‚ÄúI‚Äù for an individual voice.

#### Tip \#8:¬†Talk in Layman‚Äôs Terms

Continuing the idea of the conciseness of your copy, keep your copy simple. Research from The Literacy Project tells us that the average American reads at¬†[7th to 8th-grade level](https://www.wyliecomm.com/2019/03/us-literacy-rate/#:~:text=The%20average%20American%20reads%20at%20the%207th-%20to%208th-grade,according%20to%20The%20Literacy%20Project.). If you use simple language, your readers might be more likely to understand and remember more.

Make sure you:

- Use short sentences ‚Äî¬†they help to communicate your message clearly.
- Limit¬†the use of adverbs and adjectives in order to keep sentences short and snappy.
- Avoid using jargon ‚Äî¬†not all readers are experts, so replace professional terminology with simpler alternatives and provide hyperlinks to other articles with more background information.
- Provide examples ‚Äî¬†readers better visualize your messages with examples rather than high-level statements.

#### Tip \#9:¬†Avoid Spelling, Grammar, or Punctuation Errors

It should go without saying, but the content on any platform should be free from spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Sloppy mistakes can put off a huge swathe of potential customers.

#### Tip \#10:¬†Encourage Readers to Act

Remember me saying that you should know your goal from the beginning? It‚Äôs time to apply this knowledge.

The purpose of your web copy is to encourage some kind of action. It might be that you want visitors to make a purchase, subscribe to your blog, or join your mailing list, etc.

By including a clear call to action using words like ‚ÄúJoin,‚Äù ‚ÄúSign Up,‚Äù ‚ÄúGet a Call,‚Äù ‚ÄúSubscribe,‚Äù ‚ÄúWatch,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù you can help to initiate the desired activity.

#### Tip \#11:¬†Demonstrate Proof that the CTA Is Worth It

A good strategy is to include some proof to back up statements you have made about your products or services. This might be through success stories, original research data, customer testimonials, a relevant expert‚Äôs biography, or partnerships. This will help show your expertise and dispel any doubts that may inhibit the customer‚Äôs action.

#### Tip \#12:¬†Add Visuals

People remember only 20% of what they read, but¬†[80% of what they see and do](https://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/). If you add infographics, pictures, graphs, or videos to your copy, this will help people process information and grab their attention.

Here, a colleague of mine wrote more ideas on¬†[what interactive content you can create](https://www.semrush.com/blog/interactive-content/)¬†to interact with your audience ‚Äî¬†quizzes, calculators, infographics, games, maps, etc.

These are the main aspects of writing¬†strong, impactful copy. For those who prefer to order content on our Marketplace, we have a guide on how to write your terms of reference and¬†[evaluate the work of a copywriter](https://www.semrush.com/blog/seo-copywriting/).

## Post-Writing Tips

You‚Äôve written the text, but the work goes on because you need to ensure its searchability and regularly update it.

#### Tip \#13:¬†Optimize for Search Engines

While it‚Äôs essential to focus on your human audience, it‚Äôs a foolhardy move to ignore Google‚Äôs power. It‚Äôs important to optimize content for the audience and ensure that the relevant keywords are included in titles, subheadings, and meta descriptions.

It‚Äôs important to avoid¬†[keyword stuffing](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358?hl=en), though, which can damage your rankings with search engines. Aiming for a 1-2% keyword density is about right.

You aim to produce copy which will be valuable to customers and help them to make decisions. Alongside this, you also need to remember the basics of SEO:

- **Include keywords in headlines and sub-headers.**¬†Add the primary¬†[keyword to the title](https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-create-seo-friendly-content-with-semrush/#header8)¬†and H1 and 5-10 additional ones to the¬†[subheadings and body text](https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-create-seo-friendly-content-with-semrush/#header11).
- **Take care of the metadata**. Describe the specific web page in¬†[1-2 sentences](https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-create-seo-friendly-content-with-semrush/#header10)¬†to encourage a user to click on your link over your competitors‚Äô.
- **Make your URLs readable.**¬†Help your readers to understand¬†[what‚Äôs inside](https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-create-seo-friendly-content-with-semrush/#header13)¬†the page.
- **Add relevant and helpful links.¬†**This way, you will encourage visitors to¬†[stay longer](https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-create-seo-friendly-content-with-semrush/#header14)¬†on the website, and you will rise in Google‚Äôs estimation.
- **Optimize your visual content.¬†**[Resize images](https://www.semrush.com/blog/how-to-create-seo-friendly-content-with-semrush/#header12)¬†to make the site loading faster, and add alt tags for search engines.

#### Tip \#14:¬†Keep Your Website Fresh and Up to Date

One of the first things people do after they hear about a company is look up its website. Your website is your business card, so be sure to make a good first impression.

- **Refresh your content from time to time.**¬†Add some new relevant information such as new stats and trends or new product details.
- **Update your outdated banners or CTAs.**¬†Replace them with relevant offers to reactivate your content marketing funnel and improve your conversion rates.
- **Make sure the copy performs well.**¬†Underperforming copy may need more examples, tips, and practical details.
- **Repurpose your content.**¬†You can¬†[try a different format](https://www.semrush.com/blog/guide-to-repurposing-content-in-2020/)¬†for this content, such as creating a video and incorporating it into the page.
- **Optimize internal linking.**¬†Add links pointing to new articles in blog posts with related topics.

You should also regularly review your¬†[content strategy](https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-audit-for-content-marketing-strategy/)¬†to ensure that your web copy has the desired impact on visitor journeys through your website.

### Here are the problems without solutions for you to practice¬†with:

---

### Problem 1

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn `100` years old.

The `datetime` module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html"><strong>datetime ‚Äì Basic date and time types ‚Äì Python 3.9.6 documentation</strong><br />
<em>Only one concrete class, the class, is supplied by the module. The class can represent simple timezones with fixed‚Ä¶</em>docs.python.org</a><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage mixtapeImage--empty u-ignoreBlock"></a>

### Problem 2

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is `even` or `odd`, print out an appropriate message to the user.

#### Bonus:

1.  <span id="eebc">If the number is a multiple of `4`, print out a different message.</span>
2.  <span id="306e">Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.</span>

### Problem 3

Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are `less` than `5`.

Extras:

1.  <span id="fe03">Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than `5` from this list in it and print out this new list.</span>
2.  <span id="186b">Write this in one line of Python.</span>
3.  <span id="9cd1">Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.</span>

### Problem 4

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don‚Äôt know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.

For example, `13` is a divisor of `26` because `26 / 13` has no remainder.)

### Problem 5

Take two lists, and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are `common between the lists (without duplicates)`. Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"><strong>random ‚Äì Generate pseudo-random numbers ‚Äì Python 3.9.6 documentation</strong><br />
<em>Source code: Lib/random.py This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions. For‚Ä¶</em>docs.python.org</a><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage mixtapeImage--empty u-ignoreBlock"></a>

Bonus:

1.  <span id="e18a">Randomly generate two lists to test this.</span>
2.  <span id="148a">Write this in one line of Python.</span>

### Problem 6

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a `palindrome` or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

> Here‚Äôs 5 ways to reverse a string (courtesy of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-string-python-5-different-ways/" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor">geeksforgeeks</a>)

---

### Problem 7

Let‚Äôs say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]`.

Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the `even` elements of this list in it.

### Problem 8

Make a two-player `Rock-Paper-Scissors` game.

**Hint:**  
Ask for player plays (using input), compare them. Print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/2dc55-01_4w6u4d7edi2r4h.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Problem 9

Generate a random number between `1 and 100 (including 1 and 100)`. Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed `too low`, `too high`, or `exactly right`.

> **Hint:**  
> Remember to use the user input from the very first exercise.

**Extras:**  
Keep the game going until the user types `‚Äúexit‚Äù`.  
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

### Problem 10

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.

**Hint:**  
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ‚Ä¶`

### Problem 11

In linear algebra, _a Toeplitz matrix is one in which the elements on any given diagonal from top left to bottom right are identical._  
Here is an example:

    1 2 3 4 8
    5 1 2 3 4
    4 5 1 2 3
    7 4 5 1 2

Write a program to determine whether a given input is a `Toeplitz` matrix.

### Problem 12

Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:  
‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää-&gt; You may decrement N to N‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää1.  
‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää-&gt; If `a * b = N`, you may decrement `N to the larger of a and b`.

For example, given 100, you can reach 1 in 5 steps with the following route:  
`100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.`

### Problem 13

Consider the following scenario: there are `N` mice and `N` holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized.

Each move consists of moving one mouse `one` unit to the `left` or `right`, and only `one` mouse can fit inside each hole.

For example, suppose the mice are positioned at `[1, 4, 9, 15]`, and the holes are located at `[10, -5, 0, 16]`. In this case, the best pairing would require us to send the mouse at `1` to the hole at `-5`, so our function should return `6`.

### Install

Chromium download starts automatically when Markdown PDF is installed and Markdown file is first opened with Visual Studio Code.

However, it is time-consuming depending on the environment because of its large size (~ 170Mb Mac, ~ 282Mb Linux, ~ 280Mb Win).

During downloading, the message `Installing Chromium` is displayed in the status bar.

If you are behind a proxy, set the `http.proxy` option to settings.json and restart Visual Studio Code.

If the download is not successful or you want to avoid downloading every time you upgrade Markdown PDF, please specify the installed [Chrome](https://www.google.co.jp/chrome/) or ‚ÄòChromium‚Äô with [markdown-pdf.executablePath](https://trusting-aryabhata-e5438d.netlify.app/#markdown-pdfexecutablepath) option.

<!-- -->

    .emoji {
      height: 2em;
    }

### Auto guess encoding of¬†files

Using `files.autoGuessEncoding` option of the Visual Studio Code is useful because it automatically guesses the character code. See [files.autoGuessEncoding](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_11#_auto-guess-encoding-of-files)

    "files.autoGuessEncoding": true,

### Output directory

If you always want to output to the relative path directory from the Markdown file.

For example, to output to the ‚Äúoutput‚Äù directory in the same directory as the Markdown file, set it as follows.

    "markdown-pdf.outputDirectory" : "output",
    "markdown-pdf.outputDirectoryRelativePathFile": true,

### Page Break

Please use the following to insert a page break.

    <div class="page"/>

### Known Issues

### Ruby for Visual Studio¬†Code

This extension provides enhanced Ruby language and debugging support for Visual Studio Code.

### Features

- Automatic Ruby environment detection with support for rvm, rbenv, chruby, and asdf
- Lint support via RuboCop, Standard, and Reek
- Format support via RuboCop, Standard, Rufo, Prettier and RubyFMT
- Semantic code folding support
- Semantic highlighting support
- Basic Intellisense support

### Installation

Search for `ruby` in the [VS Code Extension Gallery](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) and install it!

### Initial Configuration

By default, the extension provides sensible defaults for developers to get a better experience using Ruby in Visual Studio Code. However, these defaults do not include settings to enable features like formatting or linting. Given how dynamic Ruby projects can be (are you using rvm, rbenv, chruby, or asdf? Are your gems globally installed or via bundler? etc), the extension requires additional configuration for additional features to be available.

### Using the Language¬†Server

It is **highly recommended** that you enable the Ruby language server (via the Use Language Server setting or `ruby.useLanguageServer` config option). The server does not default to enabled while it is under development but it provides a significantly better experience than the legacy extension functionality. See [docs/language-server.md](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/language-server.md) for more information on the language server.

Legacy functionality will most likely not receive additional improvements and will be fully removed when the extension hits v1.0

### Example Initial Configuration:

    "ruby.useBundler": true, //run non-lint commands with bundle exec
    "ruby.useLanguageServer": true, // use the internal language server (see below)
    "ruby.lint": {
      "rubocop": {
        "useBundler": true // enable rubocop via bundler
      },
      "reek": {
        "useBundler": true // enable reek via bundler
      }
    },
    "ruby.format": "rubocop" // use rubocop for formatting

Reviewing the [linting](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/linting.md), [formatting](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/formatting.md), and [environment detection](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/language-server.md) docs is recommended

For full details on configuration options, please take a look at the `Ruby` section in the VS Code settings UI. Each option is associated with a name and description.

### Debug Configuration

See [docs/debugger.md](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/debugger.md).

### Legacy Configuration

[docs/legacy.md](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/legacy.md) contains the documentation around the legacy functionality

### Troubleshooting

See [docs/troubleshooting.md](https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md)

### Other Notable Extensions

- [Ruby Solargraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSolargraph is a language server that provides intellisense, code completion, and inline documentation for Ruby.

Extension uses relevant comment characters for all common languages.

For example, in python files subheader looks like

    # ------------------------------ python example ------------------------------ #

or in html files

    <!-- ---------------------------- html example ----------------------------- -->

**Also, you can easily** [**add support**](https://trusting-aryabhata-e5438d.netlify.app/#languages-configuration) **for any missing language or override the default preset.**

### Default Configuration

### Common

    // Set line length for all dividers.
      "comment-divider.length": 80,

### Main Header

    // "Set symbol for main header line filling (only one).
      "comment-divider.mainHeaderFiller": "-",

      // Set main header vertical style.
      "comment-divider.mainHeaderHeight": "block",

      // Set main header text align.
      "comment-divider.mainHeaderAlign": "center",

      // Set main header text transform style.
      "comment-divider.mainHeaderTransform": "none",

### Subheader

    // "Set symbol for subheader line filling (only one).
      "comment-divider.subheaderFiller": "-",

      // Set subheader vertical style.
      "comment-divider.subheaderHeight": "line",

      // Set subheader text align.
      "comment-divider.subheaderAlign": "center",

      // Set subheader text transform style.
      "comment-divider.subheaderTransform": "none",

### Solid Line

    // Set symbol for solid line filling.
      "comment-divider.lineFiller": "-",

### Languages Configuration

If some language is not supported out of the box, or you want to change default comment characters for an already supported language, it is possible to do it in the settings.

    "comment-divider.languagesMap": {
          "toml": ["#", "#"],
          "scss": ["//"]
    }

The item name is the language mode name and is associated with an array of 1 or 2 elements. The first element is the start of the line. The second, if defined, is the end.

The example above defines the right characters for `toml` and overrides `scss` defaults. As a result, the subheaders for these languages look like this:

    # ------------------------------ toml subheader ------------------------------ #

    // ----------------------------- scss subheader --------------------------------

### Indent-Rainbow

### A simple extension to make indentation more¬†readable

If you like this plugin, please consider a small donation:

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/912b7-0oyuoktkyg5xyl8ku.gif)

---

This extension colorizes the indentation in front of your text alternating four different colors on each step. Some may find it helpful in writing code for Nim or Python.

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/b0a4a-0jopzwr3l1nwouh3d.png)

Get it here: [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)

It uses the current editor window tab size and can handle mixed tab + spaces but that is not recommended. In addition it visibly marks lines where the indentation is not a multiple of the tab size. This should help to find problems with indentation in some situations.

### Configuration

Although you can just use it as it is there is the possibility to configure some aspects of the extension:

    // For which languages indent-rainbow should be activated (if empty it means all).
      "indentRainbow.includedLanguages": [] // for example ["nim", "nims", "python"]

      // For which languages indent-rainbow should be deactivated (if empty it means none).
      "indentRainbow.excludedLanguages": ["plaintext"]

      // The delay in ms until the editor gets updated.
      "indentRainbow.updateDelay": 100 // 10 makes it super fast but may cost more resources

_Notice: Defining both_ `includedLanguages` _and_ `excludedLanguages` _does not make much sense. Use one of both!_

You can configure your own colors by adding and tampering with the following code:

    // Defining custom colors instead of default "Rainbow" for dark backgrounds.
      // (Sorry: Changing them needs an editor restart for now!)
      "indentRainbow.colors": [
        "rgba(255,255,64,0.07)",
        "rgba(127,255,127,0.07)",
        "rgba(255,127,255,0.07)",
        "rgba(79,236,236,0.07)"
      ]

      // The indent color if the number of spaces is not a multiple of "tabSize".
      "indentRainbow.errorColor": "rgba(128,32,32,0.6)"

      // The indent color when there is a mix between spaces and tabs.
      // To be disabled this coloring set this to an empty string.
      "indentRainbow.tabmixColor": "rgba(128,32,96,0.6)"

> _Notice:_ `errorColor` _was renamed from_ `error_color` _in earlier versions._

Skip error highlighting for RegEx patterns. For example, you may want to turn off the indent errors for JSDoc‚Äôs valid additional space (disabled by default), or comment lines beginning with `//`

    // Example of regular expression in JSON (note double backslash to escape characters)
      "indentRainbow.ignoreLinePatterns" : [
        "/[ \t]* [*]/g", // lines begining with <whitespace><space>*
        "/[ \t]+[/]{2}/g" // lines begininning with <whitespace>//
      ]

Skip error highlighting for some or all languages. For example, you may want to turn off the indent errors for `markdown` and `haskell` (which is the default)

    "indentRainbow.ignoreErrorLanguages" : [
        "markdown",
        "haskell"
      ]

If error color is disabled, indent colors will be rendered until the length of rendered characters (white spaces, tabs, and other ones) is divisible by tabsize. Turn on this option to render white spaces and tabs only.

    "indentRainbow.colorOnWhiteSpaceOnly": true // false is the default

Build with:

    npm install
    npm run vscode:prepublish

Running `npm run compile` makes the compiler recompile on file change.

### Path Intellisense

Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames.

### Sponsors

Eliminate context switching and costly distractions. Create and merge PRs and perform code reviews from inside your IDE while using jump-to-definition, your favorite keybindings, and other IDE tools.  
[Learn more](https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=vscmarket&utm_campaign=pathintel&utm_medium=banner "Try CodeStream")

### Installation

In the command palette (cmd-shift-p) select Install Extension and choose Path Intellisense.

To use Path Intellisense instead of the default autocompletion, the following configuration option must be added to your settings:

    { "typescript.suggest.paths": false }

### Usage

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/c6dbe-0tlylrlqtyv3zdein.gif)

### Node packages intellisense

Use [npm intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)

### BaseUrl

Pathintellisense uses the ts.config.compilerOptions.baseUrl as a mapping. So no need to define it twice. There is no support for paths at the moment.

For example:

    {
        "baseUrl": "src",
    }

would allow to type:

    {
      import {} from "src/mymodule";
    }

### Settings

### File extension in import statements

Path Intellisense removes the file extension by default if the statement is a import statement. To enable file extensions set the following setting to true:

    {
        "path-intellisense.extensionOnImport": true,
    }

### Show hidden¬†files

Per default, hidden files are not displayed. Set this to true to show hidden files.

    {
        "path-intellisense.showHiddenFiles": true,
    }

If set to false, PathIntellisense ignores the default ‚Äúfiles.exclude‚Äù as well:

    {
        "files.exclude": {
            "**/*.map.js": true
        }
    }

### Auto slash when navigating to¬†folder

Per default, the autocompletion does not add a slash after a directory.

    {
        "path-intellisense.autoSlashAfterDirectory": false,
    }

### Absolute paths

Per default, absolute paths are resolved within the current workspace root path. Set it to false to resolve absolute paths to the disk root path.

    {
        "path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace": true,
    }

### Mappings

Define custom mappings which can be useful for using absolute paths or in combination with webpack resolve options.

    {
        "path-intellisense.mappings": {
            "/": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "lib": "${workspaceFolder}/lib",
            "global": "/Users/dummy/globalLibs"
        },
    }

Use ${workspaceFolder} when the path should be relative to the current root of the current project. V2.2.1 and lower used ${workspaceRoot}. Newer version support both placeholders.

### React snippets

Are only enabled in `jsx` or `tsx` files. If you write your jsx in `js` files, you need to copy the `react.json` files manually and add it to your custom snippets.

### Why do we include them¬†here?

If you‚Äôre not writing react, including them should not really bother you because they are not short as the regular JS snippets. Also IMHO react is the leading solution for FE apps deserves to be included by default, because any JS dev will have to write some react eventually over the course of his/her careeer. By having them in a single package we can easily make sure -there aren‚Äôt any conflicts in the trigger prefixes.

### Supported languages (file extensions)

- JavaScript (.js)
- TypeScript (.ts)
- JavaScript React (.jsx)
- TypeScript React (.tsx)

These were originally taken from <https://github.com/TimonVS/vscode-react-standard> because the maintainer wasn‚Äôt able to publish a new version for months even when there was a considerable flaw in the released version. Below is a list of all available snippets and the triggers of each one.

There are also snippets to be triggered with a text selection(trigger via insert snippet command):

    jsx element wrap selection

The following table lists all the snippets that can be used for prop types. Every snippet regarding prop types begins with `pt` so it‚Äôs easy to group it all together and explore all the available options. On top of that each prop type snippets has one equivalent when we need to declare that this property is also required. For example `pta` creates the `PropTypes.array` and `ptar` creates the `PropTypes.array.isRequired`

TriggerContent`ptaPropTypes.array,ptarPropTypes.array.isRequired,ptbPropTypes.bool,ptbrPropTypes.bool.isRequired,ptfPropTypes.func,ptfrPropTypes.func.isRequired,ptnPropTypes.number,ptnrPropTypes.number.isRequired,ptoPropTypes.object.,ptorPropTypes.object.isRequired,ptsPropTypes.string,ptsrPropTypes.string.isRequired,ptndPropTypes.node,ptndrPropTypes.node.isRequired,ptelPropTypes.element,ptelrPropTypes.element.isRequired,ptiPropTypes.instanceOf(ClassName),ptirPropTypes.instanceOf(ClassName).isRequired,ptePropTypes.oneOf(['News', 'Photos']),pterPropTypes.oneOf(['News', 'Photos']).isRequired,ptetPropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]),ptetrPropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.number]).isRequired,ptaoPropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number),ptaorPropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number).isRequired,ptooPropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.number),ptoorPropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.number).isRequired,ptshPropTypes.shape({color: PropTypes.string, fontSize: PropTypes.number}),ptshrPropTypes.shape({color: PropTypes.string, fontSize: PropTypes.number}).isRequired,`

### Visual Studio IntelliCode

The [Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872679) extension provides AI-assisted development features for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java developers in Visual Studio Code, with insights based on understanding your code context combined with machine learning.

You‚Äôll need Visual Studio Code October 2018 Release 1.29.1 or later to use this extension. For each supported language, please refer to the ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù section below to understand any other pre-requisites you‚Äôll need to install and configure to get IntelliCode completions.

For C\#, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, and XAML support in the Visual Studio IDE, check out the [IntelliCode extension on the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.VSIntelliCode).

### About IntelliCode

This extension provides AI-assisted IntelliSense by showing recommended completion items for your code context at the top of the completions list. The example below shows this in action for Python code.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*CQQaJIXL4J2cvEzF)

When it comes to overloads, rather than taking the time to cycle through the alphabetical list of member, IntelliCode presents the most relevant one first. In the example shown above, you can see that the predicted APIs that **IntelliCode** elevates appear in a new section of the list at the top with members prefixed by a star icon. Similarly, a member‚Äôs signature or overloads shown in the IntelliSense tool-tip will have additional text marked by a small star icon and wording to explain the recommended status. This visual experience for members in the list and the tool-tip that **IntelliCode** provides is not intended as final‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is intended to provide you with a visual differentiation for feedback purposes only.

Contextual recommendations are based on practices developed in thousands of high quality, open-source projects on GitHub each with high star ratings. This means you get context-aware code completions, tool-tips, and signature help rather than alphabetical or most-recently-used lists. By predicting the most likely member in the list based on your coding context, AI-assisted IntelliSense stops you having to hunt through the list yourself.

### Getting Started

Install the Visual Studio IntelliCode extension by clicking the install link on this page, or install from the Extensions tab in Visual Studio Code. Then follow the language-specific instructions below.

### For TypeScript/JavaScript users:

That‚Äôs it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust open a TypeScript or JavaScript file, and start editing.

### For Python¬†users:

1.  Set up the Python extension by following the steps in the [Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_prerequisites)
2.  Start editing Python files, you should get a prompt to enable the Microsoft Python Language Server, which itself is a preview release.
3.  Reload Visual Studio Code after enabling the language server
4.  After the language server finishes initializing, you should now see recommended completions

### For Java¬†users:

1.  Set up the Java extension for Visual Studio Code by following the steps in the [Java Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial)
2.  Make sure that you have a minimum of Java 8 Update 151 installed
3.  Reload Visual Studio Code after enabling the Java extension
4.  After the Java language server finishes initializing, you should now see recommended completions

## [Notes from JavaScript the Good¬†Parts](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/04/05/notes-from-javascript-the-good-parts/)

#### A condensed summary of the entire ‚ÄúJavaScript the Good Parts‚Äù¬†book

I hope these notes help shed some light and save some time‚Ä¶ (this is the most I could condense an entire book)

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/7cdec-15oamo6qxv9dztouc5oe-uq.png)

### Chapter 1‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGood¬†Parts

> _Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I discovered that I could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?_

The best parts of Javascript include:

- functions
- loose typing (variables are declared as variables, without a type)
- dynamic objects
- object literal notation (where you can create an object already with a list of key/value pairs inside curly braces)

The worst parts include global variables‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere is a common _global object_ namespace where they‚Äôre all lumped together and they‚Äôre essential to the language.

Javascript has a _class free_ object makeup, relying instead on objects inheriting properties directly from other objects‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is prototypal inheritance.

### Chapter 2‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGrammar

Always use // for comments, even multi-line ones to avoid having to escape `/*` characters.

### Numbers

- There is a single, 64-bit floating point number type.
- `NaN` (Not-a-Number) is not equal to any value (including itself) and is essentially an illegal number value, but _typeOf(NaN)===number is true_
- Use `isNaN(number)` to check for NaNs

Number methods are discussed in [Chapter 8](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main).

### Strings

- 16-bit character set and don‚Äôt have character types.
- Backslashes (\\) are used for escaping characters that could cause problems in strings.
- Strings are immutable.

Single quotes are often used to define a String in JavaScript, but if a person‚Äôs name has an apostrophe (and the developer does not know the difference between an apostrophe and single quote) it is useful to ‚Äúescape‚Äù the apostrophe character:

    var name = 'Patrick O\'Brian'; // using a backslash in front of the apostrophe
    console.log('name:', name); // name: Patrick O'Brian

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/f1e58-0flaxqcb0qgspdam_.png)

String methods are discussed in [Chapter 8](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main).

### Statements

- _Inside_ a function, the var statement creates variables local to that function
- _switch, while, for_ and _do_ statements can have an optional label which can be used with `break` and `continue` to provide more precise [control over exactly which statement to break or continue](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/practice.cgi?file=javascript_19). Format: `labelname: statement` and then `continue labelname;`
- ES2015 presents two new keywords for declaring variables, _let_ and _const_. Whereas the _var_ keyword is function scoped (the variables are local to the function), _let_ and _const_ are both block scoped, which means they are local to any statement with {}.
- _falsy_ values:
- false
- null
- undefined
- Empty string ‚Äò ‚Äò
- The number 0
- The number NaN
- All other values are _truthy_ including all objects & the string ‚Äòfalse‚Äô
- If no matches are found in `case` statements, the optional default statement is executed, otherwise the matching case statement is carried out
- When using a _for in_ loop, usually a good idea to use `hasOwnProperty(variable)` to make sure the property belongs to the object you want and is not instead an inherited property from the prototype chain:

<!-- -->

    for (myvariable in object) {
        if (object.hasOwnProperty(myvariable)) {
         //....statements to be executed
        }
    }

- A _do while_ statement is always executed at least once as the while condition is only checked after the first iteration of the loop
- `catch` clause in a _try_ statement must create a new variable that will catch the exception object
- Scope of `throw` statement is the `try` block it‚Äôs in, or the `try` of the function it‚Äôs in
- If there is no `return` statement, `return===undefined`
- `break` exits the statement and `continue` forces a new iteration of the loop, both with the optional _label_ mentioned above

### Expressions

- For `expression ? expression2 : expression3`, if expression is _truthy_, execute expresion2; if it‚Äôs _falsy_, execute expression3
- _Invocation_ is `(expression1, expression2, etc)`
- _refinement_ is either¬†`.name` or `[expression]` as used in an array

### Literals

- _Names_ or _strings_ used for specifying new objects ([object literals](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)) or arrays ([array literals](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main))
- Properties of the object are expressions and must be known at compile time

### Functions

- A function literal defines a function value
- More details in [Chapter 4](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)

### Chapter 3‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäObjects

Javascript simple types:

- numbers _(has object-like methods but they are immutable)_
- strings _(has object-like methods but they are immutable)_
- booleans _(has object-like methods but they are immutable)_
- null
- undefined

All other values are _objects_ including arrays and functions.

Objects are class free, can contain other objects and can inherit properties from their prototypes (which can _reduce object initialisation time and memory consumption_).

### Object Literals

- An object literal is _zero or more comma-separated name/value pairs surrounded by curly braces_ {}

<!-- -->

    var empty_object = {};

    var today = {
        day: "Wednesday",
        month: "April",
        year: 2014,

        weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
            morning: "sunny",
            afternoon: "cloudy"
        }
    }

### Retrieval

- Can be done with either dot notation `today.weather.morning` or with square brackets `today['month']`
- Or operand (||) can be used to fill in default values for nonexistent data to prevent and _undefined_ error: `var weath = today.weather.evening || "unknown"`

### Update

- Assigning a property value to an object overwrites any existing property values with that property name

### Reference

- Objects refer to each other, they don‚Äôt hold duplicate copies of data

### Prototype

- Every object has a prototype object from which it inherits properties
- _Object.prototype_ comes standard with Javascript and is almost like a ‚Äòroot parent‚Äô

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1MKtZt0a5gREie59)

- The `Object.create` method is now available in ES5 (but the method is in the book if required for older versions)
- If an object does not have a property you ask it for, it will keep looking up the prototype chain until it finds it
- If the property _does note exist_ anywhere in the chain, it will return _undefined_
- A new property is _immediately visible_ to all of the objects below it in the chain once created

More details in [Chapter 6](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)

### Reflection

- Determining what properties an object has
- Using `typeof` includes all properties in the prototype chain including functions
- To avoid inherited properties, use `hasOwnProperty(type);` which returns _true_ if that property exists only in that object itself (not the chain)

<!-- -->

    today.hasOwnProperty(‚Äònumber‚Äô) //will return true today.hasOwnProperty(‚Äòconstructor‚Äô) //will return false

### Enumeration

- Best way to enumerate all the properties you want is a for loop:

<!-- -->

    let i;
    var properties = [ ‚Äòday‚Äô, ‚Äòmonth‚Äô, ‚Äòyear‚Äô ];
    for (i = 0; i < properties.length; i++) {
        document.writeIn(properties[i] + ‚Äò:‚Äô + today[properties[i]]);
     }

- This ensures you get the properties you want (i.e. not up the prototype chain) and in the order you want, as opposed to a _for in_ loop which achieves neither of these

### Delete

- Removes property from object, but also reveals property from further up the prototype chain if it exists
- Format: `delete today.month`

### Global Abatement

- One way to mitigate the risks of global variables is to _create a single global variable_ which then contains your whole application

<!-- -->

    let MYAPP = {}

    MYAPP.today = {
        day: "Wednesday",
        month: "April",
        year: 2014,

        weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
            morning: "sunny",
            afternoon: "cloudy"
        }
    }
    //Making sure all other variables (like today) are contained within this one global variable (MYAPP) means none of them have global scope and therefore the risk of naming conflicts, etc in your application is reduced

- [Closures](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main) are also a way of mitigating the risks of global variables
- Note: Most [Javascript MVCs](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/) these days (2014) will take care of wrapping your app for you

### Chapter 4‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFunctions

> _The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions._

### Function Objects

- Functions are objects linked to _function.prototype_ (which is linked to _Object.prototype_).
- As well as usual object behaviour, they can be invoked.

### Function Literal

- A function literal has 4 parts:
- The (reserved) word `function` itself
- An _optional_ name (un-named functions are considered _anonymous_ functions)
- Comma-seperated parameters of the function, in parentheses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`(parameters)`
- Set of statements in curly brackets to be carried out when the function is invoked‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`{statements}`

<!-- -->

    //Format of a function
    function name (parameterA, parameterB){
        statements;
    }

- Functions can be nested within functions and the inner function can access all the parameters of the outer function as well as its own

### Invocation

- Stops the current function from running and tells the function you have invoked both to start and to use the arguments (values in parentheses) you have passed it in the invocation `function (parameters)`
- If arguments &gt; number of arguments expected, the extra values will be ignored
- If arguments &lt; number of arguments expected, the function will assume undefined in place of the missing arguments
- No error is thrown
- Note: The difference between an _argument_ and a _parameter_ is that a parameter is usually what is used in the function literal, when you‚Äôre setting up the function (almost like the placeholder for the actual values that the function will use when it is active) and an argument is usually the value passed to a function at the time it is invoked
- Parameters `this` and `arguments` are also passed to the function when it is invoked, but their value depends on how the function is invoked

#### Method Invocation Pattern

- When a function is stored as the property of the object (invoked with a dot¬†. expression) it is called on and is called a _method_

<!-- -->

    myObject.incrementFunction();

- The method is bound to the object and therefore can use `this` to retrieve or update values from the object
- These methods are highly reusable
- Because their _object context_ comes from `this` they are considered _public methods_

#### Function Invocation Pattern

- When a function is _not_ the property of an object, it is invoked as a _function_

<!-- -->

    var sum = add(3, 4);

- These functions are bound to the global object (_a ‚Äúmistake in the design of the language‚Äù according to Douglas Crockford)_ and consequently so is `this`[even in inner functions](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)
- Invoking `this` within an inner function will therefore refer to its _own_ `this` and not the one in global scope

Workaround: Artificially create a new `this`:

    myObject.double = function() {
        //in the book, the var here is called `that` but name changed for clarity
        var globalScopeThis = this; //workaround

        var innerFunc = function() {
            globalScopeThis.value = add(globalScopeThis.value, globalScopeThis.value);
        };

        innerFunc(); //invoke innerFunc as function
    };

    myObject.double();
    console.log(myObject.value);

#### Constructor Invocation Pattern

- When a function is created with `new`, that function contains a link to the function‚Äôs prototype
- This means that methods that were created for the prototype function are also available to the function created using `new`

<!-- -->

    //create a function Quo that takes a string - Quo will be our prototype function as we will see
    var Quo = function (string){
        this.status = string;
    }

    //Now create a get_status method for Quo - this will be a public method
    Quo.prototype.get_status = function () {
        return this.status;
    }

    //create a new instance of Quo using the prefix NEW
    var myQuo = new Quo("happy");

    //because of the use of the new prefix, myQuo is an instance of Quo which means it can access the public method get_status from it's prototype
    document.writeIn(myQuo.get_status());     //returns 'happy'

- This style of constructor pattern is not recommended, there will be better examples in [Chapter 5](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is noted again in [Appendix B](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)
- The first letter of a constructor function (in this case Quo) must _always_ be capitalized

#### Apply Invocation Pattern

- The `apply` method lets you choose the value to be bound to `this`
- It also takes the parameters for a function in an array
- Format: `function.apply(valueForThis, arrayOfParamentersForFunction);`

<!-- -->

    var array = [5, 2]    //will be the parameters for our function
    var sum = add.apply(null, array);     //value of 'this' is null and value of sum is 7 as the 'apply' method passes 5 and 2 to the 'add' method

### Arguments

- Another default parameter of functions is the `arguments` array which contains all the arguments that were supplied when the function was invoked
- This means you don‚Äôt have to know the exact number of arguments when you build a function because you can loop through all the arguments provided at invocation with the use of the default `arguments` array

<!-- -->

    //inside the function for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) { dosomething; //e.g. sum +=arguments[i] }

- `arguments` lacks all the array methods except¬†.length because of a bug

### Return

- When a function gets to a `return` statement, it returns immediately without carrying out the remaining statements in the function
- A function always returns a `value` or if unspecified, it returns `undefined`
- ‚ÄúIf the function was invoked with the `new` prefix (used when creating a new object so it must return an object) and the `return` value is not an object, then `this` (the new object) is returned instead.‚Äù

### Exceptions

- A `throw` statement interrupts the execution of the code is used to handle expected exceptions like an incorrect type of argument (e.g. a string where a number is expected)
- Each `throw` statement should have an exception object with a `name` holding the type of exception and a `message` with an explanation of it + any other properties you like

<!-- -->

    //Thinking through what exceptions could happen in an add function, the main function contains the throw statement with the exception object
    let add = function (a,b) {
        if (typeof a !== ‚Äònumber‚Äô || typeof b !== ‚Äònumber‚Äô){
        throw {
         name: ‚ÄòTypeError‚Äô;
         message: ‚ÄòThe add function requires numbers‚Äô;
         }
      }
    return a + b;
    }

- When you write a function to use _add()_, you include a `try` block where the exception object from the `throw` statement in _add()_ will pass control to a single catch clause for all exceptions

<!-- -->

    //When you use the function later on, add a try block with a catch clause to catch the exception object
    var try_it = function () {
        try{
            add("seven");   //will throw an exception as it is not a number
        }
        catch (e) {
            document.writeIn(e.name + ':' + e.message);
        }
    }

    try_it();    //you could rewrite this function so the argument is passed in here where it is invoked

### Augmenting Types

- Adding a method to the prototype of an object `Object.prototype` (or function, array, string, number, regular expression or boolean), you make it available to all the instances of that object so you don‚Äôt have to use the `prototype` property again
- By augmenting the _basic types_ (essentially the root prototypes), we can improve Javascript overall
- For example, adding a method named _trim_ to remove spaces from the end of strings, available to all String instances in your code:

<!-- -->

    String.method (‚Äòtrim‚Äô, function () { return this.replace(/ÀÜ\s+|\s+$/g, ‚Äò‚Äô); //uses regular expression });

- To be on the safe side, create a method conditionally, only when you know the method is missing

<!-- -->

    //Makes a method available to all functions, ONLY when it definitely does not already exist

    Function.prototype.method (methodName, func) {
        if (!this.prototype[methodName]){
            this.prototype[methodName] = func;
            return this;
        }
    };

- Remember that _for in_ statements don‚Äôt work well with prototypes

### Recursion

- Used when a task can be divided into simple sub-problems and a function can _call itself repeatedly_ to solve them
- Takes the format:

<!-- -->

    var variable = function functionName (parameters){
        //wrap the statements to be executed and the recursive call in a loop statement so it doesn't recurse forever
        //statements to be executed in the function;
        functionName(arguments);
    };

    functionName (initialArguments); //initial call to the function

- Javascript does not have _tail recursion optimization_ and therefore does not optimize recursive functions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis also means they sometimes fail if they ‚Äúrecurse very deeply‚Äù; On a side note, _tail call optimization_ is now supported in [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-tail-position-calls)

### Scope

- A _block_ is a set of statements contained in curly brackets {}
- Javascript does not have block scope but does have function scope
- All variables declared _anywhere_ within a function are available everywhere in that function‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääi.e. and inner function will have access to the variables of the outer function in which it is defined
- A variable can be _overwritten_ with a new value in an inner function and that new value‚Äôs scope will be just the body of the inner function‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas soon as you‚Äôre back out to the outer function, the value of that variable will revert to what it was before the inner function began its execution
- All variable should be declared at the top of the function body

### Closure

- Inner functions have access to the actual parameters of the outer functions (not copies)
- If an object is created as a result of a function and assigned to myObject, myObject continues to share access to the variables in the functions that created it (actual variables, not copies)
- It has access to *the context in which it was created*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is _closure_
- This includes later on, even if _the outer function has completed its execution and returned_, when the inner function is called, it will still have access to all the variables it had access to at the time it was defined (i.e. the variables that were _in context_ when the inner function was defined)

### Callbacks

- A _callback function_ is a function passed to another function as a parameter and executed in this other function
- When making a request to a server, use an _asynchronous request_ as asynchronous functions return immediately, therefore freeing up the client
- In this example, we pass the callback function to the asynchronous request as a parameter so the callback function will only be called when a response is available

<!-- -->

    request = prepare_the_request();
    send_request_asynchronously(request, function(response){
    //function being passed in as a parameter
    display(response);
    }
    );

### Module

- A module is a function or object whose contents can be used, but its state and implementation are hidden
- It is essentially using function scope and closures keep the variables and functions contained within as private as well as binding them to a non-global object‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhilst still being accessible
- Using the _module pattern_ is widely used and good practice as it promotes information hiding (avoiding naming conflicts, etc) and encapsulation
- This is a [good article on how to use the module pattern](http://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-structure-javascript-the-module-pattern-edition/) with examples
- It can also be used to produce secure objects (see [durable objects](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main) below)
- Methods contained in the object do not make use of `this` or `that` so it becomes impossible to change them from outside of the object except in ways explicitly permitted by the methods (like passing them a parameter)
- The methods can be _replaced_ but the secrets of how these methods function (like how they generate a number for example) can‚Äôt be revealed because they are not tied to a global object

<!-- -->

    var Serial_maker = function() {
    //all variables defined in this object are now fixed and hidden from anything outside this function
    //see page 42 of book for full example
    };
    //calls to methods passing them parameters are made here

- Note: Whilst Javascript variables are usually lowercase, there is some convention around capitalizing the first letter of a Module

### Cascade

- Some methods return nothing, albeit `undefined`
- If we alter these methods to return `this` instead of `undefined`, they return the object which can then be passed to the next method, e.g `getElement(myBox).move(350,150)` gets the element and then passes is to the _move_ function for the next action
- This enables _cascades_, where you call many methods on the same object in sequence because the object is passed from one method to the next (usually separated by¬†`.` as above)
- Cascades also stop you from trying to do too much in one method and makes your code more descriptive

### Curry

- A `curry` method allows you to _partially evaluate_ an existing function
- An example is below where the function _expects two arguments_, but it is first invoked with only one (in this case using `curry` as in `add.curry(10);`) and then later passed the second argument
- It can also be explained as transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (`add(a,b)`) into a chain of functions that take a single argument each (`addA = add(A); addA(B);` where the two functions are now `add()` & `addA()`)

<!-- -->

    //set up a simple function that we will customise with curry
    var add = function (a,b){
        return a + b;
    }

    var addTen = add.curry(10);      //passes 10 as the first argument to the add() function
    addTen(20);                     //The use of the curry method in addTen means addTen === add(10, 20);

- Javascript does not have a `curry` method natively but this can be added to the `Function.protoype`:

<!-- -->

    Function.method('curry', function() {
        var slice = Array.prototype.slice,
            args = slice.apply(arguments),
            that = this;
        return function() {
            return that.apply(null, args.concat(slice.apply(arguments)));
        }
    });

### Memoization

- Storing the results of previous operations in objects (such as arrays) allows them to be reused without having to keep recalculating the value‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis optimization is called _memoization_
- Adding an object to store the results _memoizes the function_
- Particularly useful when a function is recursive and uses the results of its previous iteration in the current iteration
- A _memoizer_ function can be created to help memoize future functions:

<!-- -->

    var meoizer = function(memo, fundamental) {
        var shell = function(n) {
            var result = memo[n];
            if (typeof result !== 'number') {
                result = fundamental(shell, n);
                memo[n] = result;
            }
            return result;
        }
        return shell;
    }

### Chapter 5‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäInheritance

> _Javascript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects_

Main benefit of inheritance is code reuse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou only have to specify differences.

Javascript can _mimic_ classical inheritance but has a much richer set of code reuse patterns

- This chapter looks at the more straightforward patterns but it is always best to keep it simple

### Pseudoclassical

- The pseudoclassical code reuse pattern essentially has constructor functions (functions invoked using the `new` prefix) work like classes to mimic the classical structure
- All properties are public
- If you forget to use the `new` prefix, `this` is not bound to the new object ‚Äì it is instead bound to the global object and you‚Äôll be unwittingly altering these instead!
- There is no need to use it, there are better code reuse patterns in JavaScript

### Object Specifiers

Rather than: `var myObject = maker (f, l, m, c, s)` which has too many parameters to remember in the right order, use an _object specifier_:

    var myObject = maker ({      //note curly braces
        first: f,
        last: l,
        state: s,
        city: c
        }
    ;)

to contain them. They can now be listed in any order

Also useful to pass object specifiers to JSON ([see Appendix E notes](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main))

### Prototypal

- Zero classes, one object inherits from another
- Create an object literal of a useful object and then make an instance of it using the format `var myObject = Object.create(originalObjectName)`
- When you then customise the new object (adding properties or methods through the dot notation for example), this is _differential inheritance_, where you specify the differences from the original object

### Functional

- All properties of an object are visible (Javascript has no classes so there is no such thing as a ‚Äòprivate variable‚Äô which can only be seen within a class as per other languages)
- When you use a _function_ to create your original object and the same with the object instances, you‚Äôre essentially utilising Javascript functional scope to create private properties and methods
- The below is an example of how you would create an original object, the `name` and `saying` properties are now completely private and only accessible to the `get_name` and `says` method

<!-- -->

    var mammal = function (spec) {
        var that = {};    //that is a new object which is basically a container of 'secrets' shared to the rest of the inheritance chain

        that.get_name = function () {
            return spec.name;
        };

        that.says = function () {
            return spec.saying || '';  //returns an empty string if no 'saying' argument is passed through the spec object when calling mammal
        };
        return that;     //returns the object that contains the now private properties and methods (under functional scope)
    }

    var myMammal = mammal({name: 'Herb'});

Creating an object ‚Äòcat‚Äô can now inherit from the `mammal` constructor and only pay attention to the differences between it and `mammal`:

    var cat = function (spec) {
        spec.saying = spec.saying || 'meow';   //if spec.saying doesn't already exists, make it 'meow'
        var that = mammal(spec);      //here the object 'container of secrets' is set up inheriting from mammal already

        //functions and property augmentations happen here

        return that;      //as above
    }

- Requires less effort and gives better encapsulation and information hiding than the pseudoclassical pattern, as well as access to super methods (see page 54 of book for super method example)
- An object created using the functional pattern _and_ making no use of `this` or `that` is a _durable object_ and cannot be compromised by attackers
- Briefly also discussed in [Module](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main) section above
- If you do want something to have access to the object‚Äôs private properties and methods, you pass it the `that` bundle (i.e. your ‚Äòcontainer of secrets‚Äô)

### Parts

- An object can be composed out of a set of parts
- For example, you can create a function that provides the object it is passed with a number of methods (which are defined in this function), where each method is a part that is added to the object

### Chapter 6‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäArrays

Javascript only has array-like objects which are slower than ‚Äòreal‚Äô arrays.

Retrieval and updating of properties works the same as with an object _except with integer property names_.

Arrays have their own literal format and their own set of methods ([Chapter 8‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMethods](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)).

### Array Literals

- An array literal is a pair of square brackets surrounding zero or more comma-seperated values `[a, b, c, etc]`
- The first value will get the property name ‚Äò0‚Äô, the second will be ‚Äò1‚Äô and so on
- Javascript allows an array to contain any mixture of values

### Length

- If you add to the array, the `length` property will increase to contain the new element ‚Äì it will not give an error
- If you set the¬†`.length` to a smaller number than the current length of the array, it will delete any properties with a subscript &gt;= the new `length`
- The `push()` method is sometimes useful to add an element to the end of an array
- `numbers.push('go') //adds the element 'go' to the end of the numbers array`

### Delete

- Elements can be deleted from the array object using `delete` but this leaves a hole in the array
- Use `array.splice(keyInArray, howManyElementsToDelete)` which changes the keys for the remaining values in the array so there is no hole left
- May be _slow_

### Enumeration

- A `for` statement can be used to iterate over all the properties of an array (as it is an object)
- Do not use `for in` as it does not iterate through the properties in order and sometimes pulls in from further up the prototype chain

### Confusion

> _The rule is simple: when the property names \[keys\] are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object._

- Arrays are most useful when property names are integers _but_ they can also accept strings as property names
- Javascript doesn‚Äôt have a good way of telling an object from an array as `typeof array === object`
- To accurately detect arrays, have to define our own function:

<!-- -->

    var is_array = function(value) {
            return Object.prototype.toString.apply(value) === '[object Array]';
      //apply(value) binds `value` to `this` & returns true if `this` is an array }

### Methods

- Array methods are stored in `Array.prototype` which can be augmented using the format:

<!-- -->

    //capital A in Array means this refers to the prototype
    Array.method('reduce', function(parameters) {
        //define variables and function
        //return a value
    });

- Remember, every array inherits and can use the methods you add to `Array.prototype`
- You can also add methods _directly to an array_ because they are objects
- `myArray.total = function () { //statements to execute; }` adds a ‚Äòtotal‚Äô function to the array `myArray`
- DO NOT USE: `Object.create()` will create an object ‚Äì lacking the `length` property ‚Äì not an array.

### Dimensions

- Using `[]` will create an empty array as they are not initialized in JavaScript
- Accessing a missing element will give you `undefined`
- If you have an algorithm that relies on the array not being empty and not having `undefined` values, you can write a function that will prep your array to have a certain number of defined values, essentially initializing it with certain values in place
- An `Array.dim` function is outlined on page 63 which will allow `var myArray = Array.dim(10,0)` to make an array with 10 zeroes starting from the first position in the array(0)
- Javascript only has one dimensional arrays but _can_ have array of arrays
- Two dimensional arrays (matrices) will have to be set up by the programmer
- page 63 gives a method for this and for explicitly setting cell values so as not to have an empty matrix

### Chapter 7‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRegular Expressions

> _A_ regular expression _is the specification of the syntax of a simple language_

Used with `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`, `string.match`, `string.replace`, `string.search` and `string.split` to interact with string (more in [Chapter 8 ‚Äì Methods](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main))

Quite convoluted and difficult to read as they do not allow comments or whitespace so a JavaScript regular expression must be on a single line

### An Example

`/ÀÜ(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?(\/{0,3})([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)(?::(\d+))?(?:\/([ÀÜ?#]*))?(?:\?([ÀÜ#]*))?(?:#(.*))?$/`

Breaking it down one portion ([factor](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main)) at a time:

- Note that the string starts and ends with a slash `/`
- `ÀÜ` indicates the beginning of a string
- `(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?`
- `(?:...)` indicates a [_noncapturing group_](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main), where the ‚Äò‚Ä¶‚Äô is replaced by the group that you wish to match, but not save to anywhere
- Suffix¬†`?` indicates the group is optional, so it could or could not exist in the string ‚Äì it could even exist more than once
- `()` around the _(\[A-Za-z\]+)_ indicates a [_capturing group_](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main) which is therefore captured and placed in the `result` array
- They groups are placed in the array in order, so the first will appear in `result[1]`
- Noncapturing groups are preferred to capturing groups because capturing groups have a performance penalty (on account of saving to the result array)
- You can also have capturing groups _within_ noncapturing groups such as `(?:Bob says: (\w+))`
- `[...]` indicates a character class
- `A-Za-z` is a character class containing all 26 letters of the alphabet in both upper and lower case
- Suffix `+` means character class will be matched _one or more times_
- Suffix¬†`:` is matched literally (so the letters will be followed by a colon in this case)
- `(\/{0,3})`
- `\/` The backslash `\` _escapes_ the forward slash `/` (which traditionally symbolises the end of the regular expression literal) and together they indicate that the forward slash `/` should be matched
- Suffix `{0,3}` means the slash `/` will be matched between 0 and 3 times
- `([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)`
- String made up of one or more (note the `+` at the end denoting possible multiple occurrences) digits, letters (upper or lower case), full stops (.) or hyphens (-)
- Note that the hyphen was escaped with a backslash `\-` as hyphens usually denote a _range_ but in this case is a hyphen within the expression
- `(?::(\d+))?`
- `\d` represents a _digit character_ so this will be a sequence of _one or more_ digit characters (as per the `+`)
- The digit characters will be immediately preceded by a colon¬†`:`
- `(\d+)` will be the fourth capturing group in this expression, it is also _optional_ (`?`) and inside a non-capturing group `(?:...)`
- `(?:\/([ÀÜ?#]*))?`
- Another optional group (`?`), beginning with a literal slash `/` (escaped by the backslash)
- The `ÀÜ` at the beginning of character class `[ÀÜ?#]` means it includes _all_ characters *except*¬†? and \#
- This actually leaves the regexp open to attack because too many characters are included in the character class
- The `*` indicates the character class will appear _zero or more_ times
- `(?:\?([ÀÜ#]*))?`
- We‚Äôve seen everything here before: An optional capturing group starting with a literal¬†`?` (escaped by the backslash) with zero or more characters that are not \#
- `(?:#(.*))?`
- Final optional group beginning with a `#`
- `.` matches any character _except a line ending character_
- `$` represents the end of a string
- Note: `ÀÜ` and `$` are important because they anchor the regexp and checks whether the string matched against it contains _only_ what is in the regexp
- If `ÀÜ` and `$` weren‚Äôt present, it would check that the string _contained_ the regexp but wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be only made up of this
- Using only `ÀÜ` checks the string _starts_ with the regexp
- Using only `$` checks the string _ends_ with the regexp

> Another example `/ÀÜ-?\d+(?:\.\d*)?(?:e[+\-]?\d+)?$/i;`

Most of this we have seen before but here are the new bits:

- The `i` at the end means _ignore case_ when matching letters
- `-?` means the minus sign is optional
- `(?:\.\d*)` matches a decimal point followed by _zero or more_ digits (123.6834.4442284 _does not match_)
- Note this expression only uses _noncapturing_ groups

### Construction

3 flags exist in regular expressions: `i` means insensitive ‚Äì ignore the character case, `g` means global ‚Äì to match multiple items and `m` means multiline ‚Äì where ÀÜ and $ can match line-ending characters

Two ways to build a regular expression: 1. _Regular Expression literals_ as per the examples above start and end with a slash `/`

- Here the flags are appended after the final slash, for example `/i`
- Be careful: `RegExp` objects made by regular expression literals share a single instance

1.  Use `RegExp` constructor

- The first parameter is the string to be made into a `RegExp` object, the second is the flag
- Useful when all information for creating the regular expression is not available at time of programming
- Backslashes mean something in the constructor, so these must be doubled and quotes must be escaped

<!-- -->

    //example creating a regular expression object that matches a JavaScript string

    var my_regexp = new RegExp("'(?:\\\\.|[ÀÜ\\\\\\'])*'", 'g');

### Elements

#### Regexp Choice

`|` provides a match if any of the sequences provided match.

In `"into".match(/in|int/);`, the _in_ will be a match so it doesn‚Äôt even look at the _int_.

#### Regexp Sequence

A _regexp sequence_ is made up of one or more regexp [factors](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main). If there are no quantifiers after the factor (like¬†`?`, `*` or `+`), the factor will be matched one time.

#### Regexp Factor

> _A_ regexp factor _can be a character, a parenthesized group, a character class, or an escape sequence._

It‚Äôs essentially a portion of the full `RegExp`, like what we broke down the regexp above into.

- The following special characters must all be _escaped_ with a backslash `\` to be taken literally, or they will take on an alternative meaning: / \[ \] ( ) { }¬†? + \* |¬†. ÀÜ$
- The `\` prefix does not make letters or digits literal
- When unescaped:
- `.` matches any character except line-ending
- `ÀÜ` matches the beginning of the text when `lastIndex` property is zero, or matches line-ending character when the `m` flag is present
- Having `ÀÜ` inside a [character class](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main) means NOT, so \[ÀÜ0-9\] means _does not_ match a digit
- `$` matches the beginning of the text or a line-ending character when the `m` flag is present

#### Regexp Escape

As well as escaping special characters in regexp factors, the backslash has additional uses:

- As in strings, `\f` is the formfeed character, `\n` is new line, `\r` is carriage return, `\t` is tab and `\u` specifies Unicode as a 16-bit hex. But `\b` is _not_ a backspace character
- `\d` === \[0-9\] and `\D` is the opposite, NOT (ÀÜ) a digit, \[ÀÜ0-9\]
- `\s` matches is a partial set of Unicode whitespace characters and `\S` is the opposite
- `\w` === \[0-9A-Za-z\] and `\W` === \[ÀÜ0-9A-Za-z\] but useless for any real world language (because of accents on letters, etc)
- `\1` refers to the text captured in group 1 so it is matched again later on in the regexp
- `\2` refers to group 2, `\3` to group 3 and so on

\*`\b` is a _bad part_. It was supposed to be a word-boundary anchor but is useless for multilingual applications

#### Regexp Group

Four kinds of groups:

- Capturing: `(...)` where each group is captured into the `result` array ‚Äì the first capturing group in the regexp goes into `result[1]`, the second into `result[2]` and so on
- Noncapturing `(?:...)` where the text is matched, but not captured and saved anywhere, making is _slightly faster_ than a capturing group (has no bearing on numbering of capturing groups)
- _Positive lookahead_, a bad part: `(?=...)` acts like a noncapturing group except after the match is made, it goes back to where text started
- _Negative lookahead_, a bad part: `(?!...)` is like a positive lookahead but only matches if there is no match with what is in it

#### Regexp Class

- Conveniently and easily specifies one of a set of characters using square brackets `[]`, for example vowels: `[aeiou]`
- Can shorten specification of all 32 ASCII special characters to \[!-/:-@\[-\`{-Àú\] (note that the \` in this piece of code is a back-tick)
- Also allows `ÀÜ` as the first character after the opening `[` to mean _NOT_ the characters in the character set

#### Regexp Class¬†Escape

There are _specific_ characters that must be escaped in a character class:‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää/ \[ \] ÀÜ

#### Regexp Quantifier

A _quantifier_ at the end of a factor indicates how many times the factor should be matched

- A number in curly braces means the factor should match that many times, so `/o{3}` matches _ooo_
- Two comma-seperated numbers in curly braces provide the _range_ of times a factor should match, so `{3,5}` indicates it will match 3, 4 or 5 times
- _Zero or one_ times (same thing as saying something is optional) can be¬†`?` or `{0,1}`
- _Zero or more_ times can be `*` or `{0,}`
- _One or more_ times can be `+` or `{1,}`

Prefer to use ‚Äòzero or more‚Äô or ‚Äòone or more‚Äô matching over the ‚Äòzero or one‚Äô matching‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääi.e. prefer _greedy_ matching over _lazy_ matching

### Chapter 8‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMethods

### Arrays

#### array.concat(item‚Ä¶)

Produces new array copying the original array with the `items` appended to it (does not modify the original array like `array.push(item)` does). If the `item` is an array, its elements are appended.

#### array.join(separator)

Creates a string of all the array‚Äôs elements, separated by the `separator`. Use an empty string `separator` (‚Äù) to join without separation.

#### array.pop()

Removes _last element_ of array. Returns `undefined` for empty arrays.

#### array.push(item‚Ä¶)

Modifies the _array_, appending `items` onto the end. Returns the new `length` of the array.

#### array.reverse()

_Modifies_ the array by reversing the order of the elements.

#### array.shift()

Removes the _first_ element of the array (does not leave a hole in the array‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsame effect as using the¬†`.splice(a,b)` method) and returns that first element.

#### array.slice(start, end)

Different to `splice`.

‚Äòslice‚Äô creates a new array, copying from the `start` element and stopping at the element _before_ the `end` value given. If no `end` is given, default is `array.length`.

Negative values for `start` and `end` will have `array.length` added to them and if `start`&gt;`end`, it will return an empty array.

#### array.sort(comparefn)

JavaScript has a `sort()` method which was created only to compare strings and therefore sorts numbers incorrectly (it will sort them as 1, 15, 2, 23, 54 for example). Therefore, we have to write a comparison function which returns _0_ if the two elements you are comparing are equal, a _positive number_ if the first element should come first and a _negative number_ if the second element should come first. Then pass this comparison function to `sort()` as a parameter to allow it to sort array elements _intelligently_.

Page 80-82 in the book takes you through various iterations of the comparison functions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor numbers, simple strings, objects and objects with multiple keys (for example if you want to sort objects by first _and_ last names). These should be taken from the book when required.

#### array.splice(start, deleteCount, item‚Ä¶)

Removes elements from the array making sure there are no holes left in the array. It is most popularly used for deleting elements from an array.

It removes the `deleteCount` number of elements from the array starting from the `start` position. If there are `item` parameters passed to it, it will replace the deleted elements in the array with the `items`.

It returns an array containing the deleted elements.

#### array.unshift(item‚Ä¶)

Works like `push` but adds items to the front of the array instead of the end. Returns the new `length` of the array.

### Function

#### function.apply(thisArg, \[argArray\])

The `apply` method invokes a function, passing in the object that will be bound to `this` and _optional_ array of arguments.

### Number

#### number.toExponentional(fractionDigits)

Converts _number_ to a string in exponential form (e.g. 3.14e+0). `fractionDigits` (from 0 to 20) gives the number of decimal places.

#### number.toFixed(fractionDigits)

Converts _number_ to a string in decimal form (e.g. 3.1415927). `fractionDigits` (from 0 to 20) gives the number of decimal places.

#### number.toPrecision(precision)

Converts _number_ to a string in decimal form (e.g. 3.1415927). The difference from `toFixed` is that `precision` (from 0 to 21) gives the number of total digits.

#### number.toString(radix)

Converts _number_ to a string. `radix` is an _optional_ parameter between 2 and 36 and gives the _base_. The default radix is 10.

### Object

#### object.hasOwnProperty(name)

Does not look at the property chain. Returns true if the _object_ contains the property `name`.

### RegExp

#### regexp.exec(string)

Most powerful (and _slowest_) regexp method.

Checks the `string` against the _regexp_ (starting at position 0) and returns an array containing the matches. The _regexp_ is set up with various capturing groups and these determine the elements that go in the array:

- the 0 element of the array will contain the part of `string` that matched the _regexp_
- element 1 of the array will contain the text captured by the first capturing group in _regexp_
- element 2 of the array will contain the text captured by the second capturing group in _regexp_ and so on
- if the match fails, it returns `null`

If the _regexp_ contains a `g` flag (e.g. `var regexp = /[ÀÜ<>]+|<(\/?)([A-Za-z]+)([ÀÜ<>]*)>/g;`), there is a lot more to look out for:

- Searching begins at `regexp.lastIndex` (initially zero)
- If a match is found, `lastIndex` becomes the position of the _first character of the match_
- If no match is found, `lastIndex` is reset to zero
- If searching for multiple occurrences of a pattern by calling `exec` in a loop, ensure you _reset_ `lastIndex` when exiting the loop and remember `ÀÜ` only matches _when_ `lastIndex` _is equal to zero_

Example on page 87 of the book is worth reading to improve understanding.

#### regexp.test(string)

Simplest (and _fastest_) regexp method.

If _regexp_ matches the `string` it returns _true_. Otherwise it returns _false_. Do not use the `g` flag with this method.

### String

#### string.charAt(pos)

Returns character at position `pos` in the string _starting from 0_. If `pos` is less than zero or bigger than the string itself it return an empty string.

#### string.charCodeAt(pos)

Same as `charAt` except it returns the integer that represents the _code point value of the character at position_ `pos`. Returns `NaN` if _string_.length &lt; `pos` &lt; 0.

#### string.concat(string‚Ä¶)

Creates new string concatenating various strings. `+` tends to be used instead of this method (e.g. `var cat = 'c'+'a'+'t';`)

#### string.indexOf(searchString, position)

Searches for `searchString` within _string_ starting at position `position` (an optional parameter). If `position` is not provided, search starts at the beginning of the _string_. Returns the integer _position of the first matched character_ or _-1_ if no match is found.

#### string.lastIndexOf(searchString, position)

Same as `indexOf` but searches from the end of the string instead of the beginning.

#### string.localeCompare(that)

Compares _string_ to `that` parameter and returns:

- 0 if _string_ === `that`
- -1 if _string_ &lt; `that`

_NB. ‚Äòa‚Äô &lt; ‚ÄòA‚Äô, comparison is not just in length._

#### string.match(regexp)

Works the same way as `regexp.exec(string)` if there is no `g` flag in the `regexp`.

If there is a `g` flag in teh `regexp`, it produces an array of the matches but excludes the capturing groups

#### string.replace(searchValue, replaceValue)

Searches for the `searchValue` in _string_ and replaces it with the `replaceValue`.

If `searchValue` is a:

- string, only its _first occurrence_ will be replaced with the `replaceValue`
- regexp with a g flag, _all occurrences_ will be replaced with the `replaceValue`; otherwise, only the _first occurrence_ will be replaced

If `replaceValue` is a:

- string, a `$` value has a special meaning when used in the `replaceValue` that conveys what to replace ‚Äì see table on page 90 for possible variations on `$`
- function, it is called for each match and the _string result of the function_ is used as the replacement text
- string result of the first call will replace capture group 1 of the _string_ and so on

#### string.search(regexp)

Similar to¬†`.indexOf(string)` but takes a `regexp` instead of a `string`, returning the position of the first match (or -1 if there is no match). The `g` flag is ignored.

#### string.slice(start, end)

Creates a new string by copying the characters from the `start` position to the character before the `end` position in _string_.

The `end` parameter is _optional_ and defaults to _string_.length. If either parameter is negative, _string_.length is added to it.

#### string.split(separator, limit)

Creates an array of strings by splitting apart _string_ at the points where the `separator` appears (e.g. if the separator is ‚Äò.‚Äô, ab.cd‚Äô becomes \[‚Äòab‚Äô, ‚Äòcd‚Äô\]).

- If separator is an _empty string_, an array of single characters is produced.
- `limit` is _optional_ and determines how many pieces are to be split off from the original _string_.
- The `separator` can be a `regexp` but
- text from capturing groups within the regexp will be included in the split‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääe.g. in `var e = text.split(/\s*(,)\s*/);` the commas (,) will each be included as a separate element in the resulting array
- some systems _ignore empty strings_ when the `separator` is a `regexp`

#### string.substring(start, end)

No reason to use, use `slice` instead.

#### string.toLocaleLowerCase()

Produces a new string converted to lower case, _using the rules for the particular locale_ (geography).

#### string.toLocaleUpperCase()

Produces a new string converted to upper case, _using the rules for the particular locale_ (geography).

#### string.toLowerCase()

Produces a new string converted to lower case.

#### string.toUpperCase()

Produces a new string converted to upper case.

#### String.fromCharCode(char‚Ä¶)

Produces a new string from a series of numbers. `var a = String.fromCharCode(67, 97, 116); //a === 'Cat'` _NB. You‚Äôre calling the prototype here, not replacing ‚ÄòString‚Äô with your own variable._

### Chapter 9‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäStyle

#### _JavaScripts‚Äôs loose typing and excessive error tolerance provide little compile-time assurance of our programs‚Äô quality, so to compensate, we should code with strict discipline._

> We should avoid the _bad parts_ of JavaScript, but also the useful parts that can be occasionally dangerous

> the likelihood a program will work \[as intended\] is significantly enhanced by our ability to read it

> Must be written in a clear, consistent style, including:

> Good use of whitespace

> Put at most one statement on a line

> If you have to break a statement into 2 or more lines, indent the 2nd line onwards (an extra four spaces)

> _Always_ use blocks (curly braces {}) with structured statements like `if` and `while` to avoid confusion on what the statement is actually doing

> Put the opening brace `{` on the same (first) line as the statement to avoid JavaScript‚Äôs [semicolon insertion](https://github.com/Lambda-April/Unsorted-Notes/blob/main) issues ‚Äì i.e `if (a) { ...`

> Use line comments `//comment` and not block commenting (unless you‚Äôre _commenting out_ code)

> Declare all your variables at the beginning of the function, due to JavaScript‚Äôs functional scope

- I use a single global variable to contain an application or library. Every object has its own namespace, so it is easy to use objects to organize my code. Use of closure provides further information hiding, increasing the strength of my modules.

### Chapter 10‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBeautiful Features

Each feature you add to something has a lot of different costs (documentation costs, specification, design, testing and development costs) and these are often not properly accounted for.

> _Features that offer value to a minority of users impose a cost on all users_

> _We cope with the complexity of feature-driven design by finding and sticking with the good parts. For example, microwaves do a ton of different things, but most people just use one setting, the timer and the clock. So why not design with just the good parts?_

### Appendix A‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Awful¬†Parts

Need to know what all the pitfalls are with these parts.

### Global variables

These are variables that are visible throughout the code in any scope. They can be changed at any time by any part of the program which makes them unreliable in larger complex programs. This can also lead to naming conflicts which can cause your code to fail or you to accidentally overwrite a global variable.

Defined in three ways:

- Using a `var` statement outside of any function; `var foo = value`;
- By adding a property to the global object (container of all global variables), such as `window` in browsers; `window.foo = value;`
- Using a variable without declaring it with `var`, which makes it an _implied global_; `foo = value`

### Scope

Although JavaScript has block _syntax_ (i.e. is written in blocks) like a lot of other programming languages, it has functional scope and _not_ block scope.

Variables should all be declared at the top of the function and not littered throughout the block.

### Semicolon Insertion

Attempts to correct faulty programs by automatically inserting semicolons. Do not depend on this as it can hide underlying issues.

Also ensure opening curly braces ({) are on the first line of a statement, otherwise semicolons will be erroneously inserted and cause problems:

    //Ensure curly braces open on the first line of a statement
    return {
        status: true    //for example
    };
    //instead of
    return
    {
        status:true
    };

### Reserved Words

Most JavaScript reserved words are not used in the language but cannot be used to name variables or parameters.

If used as the key in object literals, they _must_ be quoted. For example `object - {'case' : value};` or `object['final'] = value;` as _case_ and _final_ are both reserved words.

### Unicode

JavaScript characters are 16 bits which only cover the original Unicode Basic Multilingual Place.

### typeof

Watch out for:

- `typeof null` which returns ‚Äòobject‚Äô instead of ‚Äònull‚Äô
- incorrect reporting on typeof regular expressions, with some implementations returning ‚Äòobject‚Äô and some returning ‚Äòfunction‚Äô
- arrays are objects in JavaScript so `typeof array` will return ‚Äòobject‚Äô

All `object`s are _truthy_ and `null` is _falsy_, so you can use the following to tell them apart:

    if (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object') {
        //then my value is definitely an object or an array because not only is its 'typeof' an object but it's also truthy (first statement)
    }

### NaN

- `typeof NaN === 'number'` even though it stands for _not-a-number_
- If you have a chain of formulas that together produce a `NaN` then at least _one_ of them will have generated `NaN`
- Surprisingly `NaN !=== NaN`
- `isNaN(value)` can be used to distinguish numbers from NaN

For numbers, best use your own isNumber formula:

    var isNumber = function isNumber(value) {
        return typeof value === 'number' && isFinite(value);    //isFinite() rejects NaN and Infinity, but is only good for numbers, not strings
    }

### Phony Arrays

JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have real arrays, it has _array-like objects_.

- Good: No need to give them dimensions and don‚Äôt generate out-of-bounds errors
- Bad: Slower than ‚Äòreal‚Äô arrays

To test if value is an array:

    if (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object' && typeof my_value.length === 'number' &&
        !(my_value.propertyIsEnumerable('length'))) {
            //my_value is definitely an array!
    }

The `arguments` array isn‚Äôt an array, just an object with a length property.

### Falsy Values

`0`, `NaN`, `''`, `false`, `null` and `undefined` are all _falsy_ values, but they are not interchangeable. When testing for a missing member of an object for example, you need to use `undefined` and not `null`.

`undefined` and `NaN` are actually global variables instead of constants but don‚Äôt change their values.

### Object

JavaScript objects inherit members from the prototype chain so they are _never truly empty_.

To test for membership without prototype chain involvement, use the `hasOwnProperty` method or limit your results (for example, to specific types like number so you know you‚Äôre not dragging in object members from up the prototype for example if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing the problem).

### Appendix B‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Bad¬†Parts

Avoid these altogether

- `==` and¬†`!=`: Don‚Äôt function properly when result is false, use `===` or¬†`!==` instead
- `with` statement: Intended to provide a shortcut to properties of an object but results vary every time it is run
- `eval`: Adds unnecessary complication and compromises the security of the application
- Giving string arguments to `setTimeout` and `setInterval` should also be avoided as this makes them act like `eval`
- `continue` statement: Forces a loop into its next iteration but the code is usually much improved when re-written _without_ `continue`
- `switch` fall through: In a `switch` statement, each `case` falls through to the next `case` unless you explicitly disrupt the flow, but using these _intentional_ fall throughs makes the _unintentional_ ones that are causing errors basically impossible to find
- This is one of those parts of JavaScript that appears useful but you‚Äôre better off avoiding because it‚Äôs occasionally very dangerous
- Block-less statements: _Always_ use curly braces `{}` to block in statements so as to avoid misinterpretation and aid error finding
- Bitwise operators: Shouldn‚Äôt really be doing this kind of manipulations because they are quite slow in JavaScript, therefore there shouldn‚Äôt be a need to use `&`, `|`, `ÀÜ`, `Àú`, `>>`, `>>>` or `<<`
- This doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt use `&&` for example
- `++` and `--`: This one seems debatable to me; Douglas Crockford finds it makes his coding style much more cryptic and difficult to read (the book uses `+=1` and `-=1` instead)

The function statement vs the function expression: To use JavaScript well, important to understand that functions are values.

- A function _statement_ is shorthand for a var statement with a function value, so `function foo() {}` (a function statement) means pretty much the same as `var foo = function foo(){};` (a function expression)
- Logically, to write the language well you should define a function before using it, but in JavaScript, function statements (using just `function foo(){}`) are _hoisted_ to the top of the scope in which they are defined ‚Äì this encourages sloppy programming and should be avoided
- function statements also don‚Äôt function consistently in `if` statements
- if you need to start a function expression with the word _function_, wrap it in parentheses (), or JavaScript assumes it‚Äôs a function _statement_

Typed wrappers: Don‚Äôt use `new Boolean` or `new String` or `new Number`, it‚Äôs completely unnecessary. Also avoid `new Object` and `new Array` and use `{}` and `[]` instead.

`new` operator: Functions that are intended to be used with `new` (conventionally starting with a capital letter) should be avoided (don‚Äôt define them) as they can cause all kinds of issues and complex bugs which are difficult to catch.

void: In JavaScript, this actually _takes_ a value and _returns_ `undefined`, which is hugely confusing and not helpful. Don‚Äôt use it.

### Appendix C‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJSLint

JSLint is a code quality tool for JavaScript which checks your syntax.

Having read through this appendix (you can read more about [JSLint here](http://www.jslint.com/)), I tend more towards [_JSHint_](http://jshint.com/about/), a _fork_ of JSLint. It allows programmers to customise for themselves which the good parts and bad parts are and define their own subset, although naturally there are a number of pre-defined options. [This is a really fantastic article on using JSHint](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-jshint); it‚Äôs simple and aimed at having you using JSHint in a few minutes as well as providing various sources for pre-defined subsets.

## [The Beginner‚Äôs Guide To¬†JavaScript](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/04/03/the-beginners-guide-to-javascript/)

#### Part 1

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/781b5-1cg0j-l4zhn7_5g2in-k-ew.png)

### How to learn effectively

**Learning**: The acquisition of skills and the ability to apply them in the future.

**What makes an Effective learner?**

- They are active listeners.
- They are engaged with the material.
- They are receptive of feedback.
- They are open to difficulty.

**Why do active learning techniques feel difficult?**

- It feels difficult because you are constantly receiving feedback, and so you are constantly adapting and perfecting the material.

**Desirable Difficulty**

- The skills we wish to obtain is often a difficult one.
- We want challenging but possible lessons based on current level of skill.

**Effective learners space their practice**

- Consistent effort &gt; cramming =&gt; for **durable knowledge**

#### Here‚Äôs a REPL to practice¬†with:

<https://replit.com/@bgoonz/lambda-prep#README.html>

---

<https://replit.com/@bgoonz/lambda-prep#README.html>

---

### Hello World

- **console.log**¬†: command used to print something onto the screen.
- **syntax**¬†: the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords in our code.
- **//**¬†: notation for creating a code comment in JS.
- **code comment**¬†: useful for annotating pieces of code to explain how something works, ignored by computer.

> **_‚ÄúSimplicity is prerequisite for reliability.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEdsger W. Dijkstra_**

---

### The Number Data¬†Type

The **number** data type in JS is used to represent any numerical values, including integers and decimal numbers.

**Basic Arithmetic Operators**

Operators are the symbols that perform particular operations.

- **+** (addition)
- **‚Äì** (subtraction)
- **asterisk** (multiplication)
- **/** (division)
- **%** (modulo)

JS evaluates more complex expressions using the general math order of operations aka PEMDAS.

- **PEMDAS**¬†: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Addition, Subtraction.
- _To force a specific order of operation, use the group operator ( ) around a part of the expression._

**Modulo**¬†: Very useful operation to check divisibility of numbers, check for even & odd, whether a number is prime, and much more! _(Discrete Math concept, circular problems can be solved with modulo)_

- Whenever you have a smaller number % a larger number, the answer will just be the initial small number.
- `console.log(7 % 10); // => 7;`

---

### The String Data¬†Type

The **string** data type is a primitive data type that used to represent textual data.

- can be wrapped by either **single** or **double** quotation marks, _best to choose one and stick with it for consistency_.
- If your string contains quotation marks inside, can layer single or double quotation marks to allow it to work.
- `"That's a great string"; (valid)`
- `'Shakespeare wrote, "To be or not to be"'; (valid)`
- `'That's a bad string'; (invalid)`
- Alt. way to add other quotes within strings is to use template literals.
- `` `This is a temp'l'ate literal ${function}` // use ${} to invoke functions within. ``
- **.length**¬†: property that can be appended to data to return the length.
- empty strings have a length of zero.
- **indices**¬†: indexes of data that begin at 0, can call upon index by using the bracket notation \[ \].

`console.log("bootcamp"[0]); // => "b"`

`console.log("bootcamp"[10]); // => "undefined"`

`console.log("boots"[1 * 2]); // => "o"`

`console.log("boots"["boot".length - 1]); // => "t"`

- we can pass expressions through the brackets as well since JS always evaluates expressions first.
- The index of the last character of a string is always one less than it‚Äôs length.
- **indexOf()**¬†: method used to find the first index of a given character within a string.
- `console.log("bagel".indexOf("b")); // => 0 console.log("bagel".indexOf("z")); // => -1`
- if the character inside the indexOf() search does not exist in the string, the output will be -1.
- the indexOf() search will return the first instanced index of the the char in the string.
- **concatenate**¬†: word to describe joining strings together into a single string.

---

### The Boolean Data¬†Type

The **boolean** data type is the simplest data type since there are only two values: **true** and **false**.

- **Logical Operators** (B*oolean Operators*) are used to establish logic in our code.
- **!** (not)¬†: reverses a boolean value.
- `console.log(!true); // => false console.log(!!false); // => false`
- **&&** (and) **Truth Table**

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/f25af-1aw4icm7-fq7znecbvh3ftw.png)

- **Logical Order of Operations**¬†: JS will evaluate¬†!, then &&, then ||.
- **De Morgan‚Äôs Law**¬†: Common mistake in boolean logic is incorrectly distributing¬†! across parentheses.
- `!(A || B) === !A && !B; !(A && B) === !A || !B;`
- In summary, to correctly distribute¬†! across parentheses we must also flip the operation within.
- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**¬†: Because JS evalutes from left to right, expressions can ‚Äúshort-circuit‚Äù. For example if we have true on the left of an || logical comparison, it will stop evaluating and yield true instead of wasting resources on processing the rest of the statement.
- `console.log(true || !false); // => stops after it sees "true ||"`

---

### Comparison Operators

All comparison operators will result in a boolean output.

**The relative comparators**

- **&gt;** (greater than)
- **&lt;** (less than)
- **&gt;=** (greater than or equal to)
- **&lt;=** (less than or equal to)
- **===** (equal to)
- **!==** (not equal to)

> _Fun Fact: ‚Äúa‚Äù &lt; ‚Äúb‚Äù is considered valid JS Code because string comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order), so ‚Äúa‚Äù is less than ‚Äúb‚Äù because it appears earlier!_

> _If there is ever a standstill comparison of two string lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the shorter string lesser._

**Difference between == and ===**

- **===**¬†: Strict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.
- **==**¬†: Loose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)

---

### Variables

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.

- We initialize a variable by using the **let** keyword and a **=** single equals sign (assignment operator).
- `let bootcamp = "Lambda"; console.log(bootcamp); // "Lambda"`
- JS variable names can contain any alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dollar signs (cannot being with a number).
- If you do not declare a value for a variable, undefined is automatically set.
- `let bootcamp; console.log(bootcamp); // undefined`
- We can change the value of a previously declared variable (let, not const) by re-assigning it another value.
- **let** is the updated version of **var**; there are some differences in terms of hoisting and global/block scope‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwill be covered later in the course (common interview question!)

**Assignment Shorthand**

    let num = 0;
    num += 10; // same as num = num + 10
    num -= 2; // same as num = num - 2
    num /= 4; // same as num = num / 4
    num *= 7; // same as num = num * 7

- In general, any nonsensical arithmetic will result in **NaN**¬†; usually operations that include undefined.
- **declaration**¬†: process of simply introducing a variable name.
- **initialization**¬†: process of both declaring and assigning a variable on the same line.

---

### Functions

A function is a procedure of code that will run when called. Functions are used so that we do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing over and over. (Think of them as ‚Äòsubprograms‚Äô)

- **Function Declaration**¬†: Process when we first initially write our function.
- Includes three things:
- Name of the function.
- A list of _parameters_ ()
- The code to execute {}
- **Function Calls**¬†: We can call upon our function whenever and wherever\* we want. (\*wherever is only after the initial declaration)
- JS evaluates code top down, left to right.
- When we execute a declared function later on in our program we refer to this as **invoking** our function.
- Every function in JS returns undefined unless otherwise specified.
- When we hit a **return** statement in a function we immediately exit the function and return to where we called the function.
- When naming functions in JS always use camelCase and name it something appropriate. &gt; Greate code reads like English and almost explains itself. Think: Elegant, readable, and maintainable!

---

### Parameters and Arguments

- **Parameters**¬†: Comma seperated variables specified as part of a function‚Äôs declaration.
- **Arguments**¬†: Values passed to the function when it is invoked.
- _If the number of arguments passed during a function invocation is different than the number of parameters listed, it will still work._
- However, is there are not enough arguments provided for parameters our function will likely yield **Nan**.

### **_space_**

> _The space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. As for most of the things in life, you can‚Äôt have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around._

### _time_

> _The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity._

### _Several operations_

> _In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element._

### _Dependent on¬†data_

> _Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity._

- <span id="bc8d">**The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best**</span>
- <span id="8b06">**The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst**</span>
- <span id="881c">**The average-case complexity: when the data looks average**</span>

### Big O¬†notation

The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.

### The Array data structure

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/86116-0qk3uygeqxamrrflr.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Definition

An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array. From Wikipedia

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures.

1.  <span id="b953">The index of an array **runs in sequence**</span>

2.  This could be useful for storing data that are required to be ordered, such as rankings or queues

3.  In JavaScript, array‚Äôs value could be mixed; meaning value of each index could be of different data, be it String, Number or even Objects

### 2. Objects

Think of objects as a logical grouping of a bunch of properties.

Properties could be some variable that it‚Äôs storing or some methods that it‚Äôs using.

I also visualize an object as a table.

The main difference is that object‚Äôs ‚Äúindex‚Äù need not be numbers and is not necessarily sequenced.

> _A Hash Table (Hash Map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A Hash Table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. From Wikipedia_

Hash Tables are considered the more efficient data structure for lookup and for this reason, they are widely used.

### The Set

### Sets

Sets are pretty much what it sounds like. It‚Äôs the same intuition as Set in Mathematics. I visualize Sets as Venn Diagrams.

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/803cd-0aiqljh9p8baw9tne.png" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gOE33ANZP2ujbjIG" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> _A Set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite Set. From Wikipedia_

The Set data structure is usually used to test whether elements belong to set of values. Rather then only containing elements, Sets are more used to perform operations on multiple values at once with methods such as union, intersect, etc‚Ä¶

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/5081e-0fls64rv-xq19avca.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> _A Singly Linked List is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes pointing to the next node by means of pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence._

Linked Lists are among the simplest and most common data structures because it allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.

### The Doubly Linked¬†List

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/6878a-0tqxir-l_itig3wp-.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> _A Doubly Linked List is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes. From Wikipedia_

Having two node links allow traversal in either direction but adding or removing a node in a doubly linked list requires changing more links than the same operations on a Singly Linked List.

### The Stack

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/c2742-0qsjyw-lvfo22ecle.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>

### _Definition_

> _A Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a Stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). From Wikipedia_

A Stack often has a third method peek which allows to check the last pushed element without popping it.

### The Queue

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/cea0c-0yvfux5tkp7-v0p7v.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> _A Queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal operations are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue. This makes the Queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the Queue will be the first one to be removed._

As for the Stack data structure, a peek operation is often added to the Queue data structure. It returns the value of the front element without dequeuing it.

### The Tree

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yUiQ-NaPKeLQnN7n" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> _A Tree is a widely used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node. A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root node. From Wikipedia_

To get a full overview of the time and space complexity of the Tree data structure, have a look to this excellent Big O cheat sheet.

### The Graph

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/f40d4-0q31ml1kjfwlizw3l.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> _A Graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected Graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed Graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected Graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed Graph. The vertices may be part of the Graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references._

- <span id="f896">A graph is **any** collection of nodes and edges.</span>
- <span id="fbda">Much more relaxed in structure than a tree.</span>
- <span id="5281">It doesn‚Äôt need to have a root node (not every node needs to be accessible from a single node)</span>
- <span id="0c79">It can have cycles (a group of nodes whose paths begin and end at the same node)</span>
- <span id="4afc">Cycles are not always ‚Äúisolated‚Äù, they can be one part of a larger graph. You can detect them by starting your search on a specific node and finding a path that takes you back to that same node.</span>
- <span id="8f45">Any number of edges may leave a given node</span>
- <span id="51cf">A Path is a sequence of nodes on a graph</span>

### Cycle Visual

<figure><img src="https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/47241-1dn1bqcdxdfg4fcvsz6uara.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>A Graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).

Representation  
There are different ways of representing a graph, each of them with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are the main 2:

Adjacency list: For every vertex a list of adjacent vertices is stored. This can be viewed as storing the list of edges. This data structure allows the storage of additional data on the vertices and edges.  
Adjacency matrix: Data are stored in a two-dimensional matrix, in which the rows represent source vertices and columns represent destination vertices. The data on the edges and vertices must be stored externally.

### üëãüèª Behavioral & Cultural Interview Questions

> _Software engineer interviewers ask behavioral/cultural questions to evaluate interviewee‚Äôs soft skills, and also to decide whether the candidate is a cultural fit. Make sure you‚Äôve prepared great answers to these interview questions._

> **_‚ö´_**Tell me about yourself

> **_‚ö´====&gt;_**‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù is one of the most common and important interview questions. However, it can be daunting, as it‚Äôs one you need to get right. After all, not only is it your first impression on the interviewer, but you also need to be simultaneously professional and authentic when answering it.

> **_‚ö´_**So how can you give a good answer without oversharing? To help you structure your answer, we‚Äôll give you a rough guideline: start with a short introduction, talk about the present, recount the past, and mention your future goals.

### What are some side projects you‚Äôre currently working¬†on?

_Current Experience_

> **\*‚ö´\*\***Outline the role you‚Äôre currently in, your responsibilities, and your achievements (without reciting your resume)\*

> **\*‚ö´\*\***Highlight what you‚Äôre most passionate about (i.e. working with PMs to perfect product specs, discussing with colleagues about different tech stacks, helping others excel in their jobs and career)\*

> **\*‚ö´\*\***Recount one or two job-related projects and/or situations that map onto the job you‚Äôre applying to (i.e. collaborating with designers, working with legacy code, implementing best-practices, introducing new tech stacks, mentoring your colleagues)\*

### Past Experience

> **Now it‚Äôs time to highlight your skills a little:**

> **_‚ö´_**Selectively highlight one high-impact (preferably quantifiable) project you were involved with for each job

> **_‚ö´_**Highlight the hard and soft skills you learned from your past working experiences

> **_‚ö´_**Emphasize the initiatives you took to improve the company‚Äôs work flow (i.e. propose new flow to streamline sprints) or your own skillsets (i.e. engaging in hackathon with colleagues or friends)

### Future Expectations

> **_‚ö´_**Convey what you hope to achieve and learn from the new job

> **_‚ö´_**Detail products, projects, features, or initiatives you can imagine yourself help kick off and lead in the company

> **_‚ö´_**Tell me what a productive day at work looks like to you

> **_‚ö´_**This question may not appear in every interview, but when they do, it‚Äôs important for you to highlight your organizational and prioritization skills. When hiring managers ask this question, they want to know:

> **_‚ö´_**Whether you‚Äôre a proactive communicator and a good planner of your time

### How you strike a balance between multiple ongoing¬†projects

D**_escribe one or two instances where you had several projects running simultaneously and how you managed to prioritize different tasks, make progress, meet milestones, and work on iterations based on feedback._**

> **_‚ö´_**How you deliver quality work with limited time

> **_‚ö´_**When there‚Äôs limited time and multiple projects going on, you may not be able to give 100% to the projects at hand. Let the interviewers know:

> **_‚ö´_**How you decide which tasks should be prioritized

> **_‚ö´_**How you negotiate deadlines and milestones with stakeholders

> **_‚ö´_**How you ensure all projects will be delivered with acceptable quality

> **_‚ö´_**At what milestones you believe it‚Äôs ok to deliver something ‚Äúless than perfect‚Äù

> **_‚ö´_**How you decide when to go back and improve the ‚Äúminimum viable projects‚Äù delivered earlier in the project‚Äôs timeline

### Professional Skills

> **_‚ö´_**Will you excel in this job? Are you passionate about this job? It‚Äôs time to show how. For the first question, highlight some of your professional abilities:

> **_‚ö´_**Industry experience

> **_‚ö´_**Technical skills

> **_‚ö´_**Soft skills

> **_‚ö´_**Key accomplishments

#### For the second question, showcase your excitement for the job. Hiring managers want to see your excitement for these¬†reasons:

> **_‚ö´1&gt;_**Excitement will fuel your performance

> **_‚ö´2&gt;_**Passion will confirm that you‚Äôre interested in this job

> **_‚ö´_**Eagerness will help you get through challenges at work

> **_‚ö´_**Company culture and shared values

> **_‚ö´_**Do you know the company‚Äôs culture and will you be a good fit? Here are some culture-related points you could cover in your answer:

> **_‚ö´_**You‚Äôre attracted to the company‚Äôs general reputation

> **_‚ö´_**You‚Äôre inspired by a specific leader in the company

> **_‚ö´_**You‚Äôre passionate about the company‚Äôs products and services

> **_‚ö´_**You‚Äôre onboard with the company‚Äôs initiatives (community engagement, public endorsements, etc.)

> **_‚ö´_**You admire the company‚Äôs culture. Here are some specific examples:

---

### Commitment to the¬†company

> **_‚ö´Are you passionate about the company and will you stay committed to this company? If the interviewer already asked you ‚ÄúWhere do you see yourself in 5 years?‚Äù then you don‚Äôt have to stress too much about showing your long-term commitment when answering this question. However, if you haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to show your commitment to the company, the most organic way to show your commitment is to talk about your long term plans in the company. Here are some things you can talk about:_**

> **_‚ö´_**Projects you want to start

> **_‚ö´_**Potential directions you think the company can go in

> **_‚ö´_**The different products/teams you want to contribute to

> **_‚ö´_**Processes you‚Äôd like to participate in improving

### Why should we hire¬†you?

> **_‚ö´_**Ultimately, every single question interviewers ask you is related to this overarching question: ‚ÄúWhy should we hire you?‚Äù Interviewers want to know, as confidently as possible, that you will be a good hire. Therefore, your answer should confirm that you‚Äôll be a good hire.

> **_‚ö´_**Unlike the more specific questions we‚Äôve outlined above, this question is a generic question that requires a concise but powerful answer. Think about this as your elevator pitch‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou should be able to sell yourself to the interview within a matter of minutes.

> **_‚ö´_**To come up with your elevator pitch, you‚Äôll need to do some planning and consolidation.

> **_‚ö´_**Here are some guiding questions for you to kickoff your brainstorming sessions:

> **_‚ö´_**What are the most important qualifications for this position from the company‚Äôs perspective?

> **_‚ö´_**What are my strong suits and how do they set me apart from others?

> **_‚ö´_**What are my most monumental accomplishments?

> **_‚ö´_**Why are you the best person for this job?

> **_‚ö´_**Consolidate and practice your pitch

> **_‚ö´_**Combine your answers in prose form to make sure each point flows to the next smoothly

> **_‚ö´_**Check to make sure your answer sets you apart from other candidates

> **_‚ö´!!!!!!!_**Practice, practice, and practice, but DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE YOUR PITCH!!!!!!!!!

### üìù Interview Etiquette & Other¬†Tips

Nailing an interview takes more than just knowing how to answer common interview questions. You‚Äôll also need to prepare questions of your own, think about salary, and get your communications right. Here‚Äôs how.

#### Questions to ask in an interview

‚ÆïAs the job seeker, it‚Äôs normal to feel like you‚Äôre being interrogated during interviews. However, at its core, an interview is a conversation, and should be a two-way interaction. As the interviewee, you need to stay engaged and ask thoughtful questions.

‚ÆïBy asking questions, you‚Äôre expressing your genuine curiosity towards the company. This helps companies know that you‚Äôre serious about them. Additionally, it also helps you evaluate whether the job and/or the company is really what you‚Äôre looking for.

‚ÆïThere are fantastic resources out there with more than a dozen questions you can ask interviewers. Here, we‚Äôll provide a few that we think are essential to help you gain deeper understandings about the role, company, and your future within the company:

‚ÆïThe job and cross-team communication

‚ÆïThe company‚Äôs values and working culture

‚ÆïWhat are some shared qualities and characteristics among your employees?

‚ÆïWhat‚Äôs your favorite part about working at the company?

‚ÆïWhat‚Äôs your least favorite part about working at the company?

Professional growth opportunities

‚ÆïAre there multiple product/service teams in the company? Can engineers apply to join a different team? What does the process look like?

‚ÆïAre there professional development courses and training available?

‚ÆïDo senior engineers and engineering leads usually get promoted from within the company?

### Closing questions and next¬†steps

> **_‚ö´_**Is there anything unclear or concerning about my background that I can help clarify?

> **_‚ö´_**What are the next steps in the interview process?

> **_‚ö´_**Is there anything else I can provide you with that would be helpful?

> **_‚ö´_**How to answer salary expectations?

> **_‚ö´_**‚ÄúWhat are you salary expectations?‚Äù can be a daunting question. If talking about money wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable enough already, most job seekers worry that proposing the ‚Äúwrong number‚Äù would cost them the job‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor land them a job offer with a disappointing salary. Not great.

---

### Follow up¬†?????

> **_‚ö´_**Depending on how many rounds of interviews you‚Äôve gone through, you may feel differently about how close you are to getting the job. The closer you get to the end of the hiring process, the more likely it is for you to start feeling anxious due to higher expectations. As a result, you may be eager to follow up with the hiring manager regarding your interview results. With that said, there‚Äôs a fine line between showing your eager attitude and coming off as desperate.

> **_‚ö´_**Before we get to the types of follow up emails you should send out, make sure to ask the hiring manager about when you can expect to hear back from them about next steps. This information will help you decide when it‚Äôs appropriate to follow up down the line.

> **_‚ö´_**There are four types of follow up emails you should send at different times after the interview: Thank you email, checking-in email, second follow up email, final follow up email.

#### Thank you¬†email

**A thank you email should be sent out on the same day of the interview or one day after your interview. The main purpose of this email is to show your excitement and appreciation. This email should be short and sweet and should include:**

#### A thank you note for their¬†time

‚Æï**A brief mention of the specific job you interviewed for**

‚Æï**A brief note of what you found most impressive about the company**

‚Æï**One or two things you learned about the organization**

‚Æï**One sentence about how you‚Äôre excited you are to contribute in a specific way**

### **_Technical interview¬†:_**

#### ‚Æï**_questions examine a candidate‚Äôs thought processes and assess what approaches they adopt to solve problems. The most common end-to-end software development questions are listed¬†below._**

### Here‚Äôs the repo that I use to practice my technical chops for interviews:

<a href="https://medium.com/star-gazers/the-web-developers-technical-interview-e347d7db3822" class="m-story">View at Medium.com</a>

### 1. Development

> **_‚ö´Describe the process you used for a recent project, from requirements to delivery. Does your team prefer using Agile or Waterfall? Any pros and cons?_**

> **_‚ö´ In answering this question, you need to show your planning, process, and communication/collaboration skills. Think in advance about a suitable project where your contributions cover all these bases._**

> **_‚ö´If you can, it‚Äôs best to choose to describe an Agile project you worked on, as organizations whether they use a Waterfall or Agile methodology, are keen to work with developers experienced in Agile._**

> **_‚ö´ Ideally, share a project in which you worked with a bigger team._**

> **_‚ö´ Outline the components of the project and what role you played._**

> **_‚ö´ Highlight any interactions with other teams and the process for handover and collaboration._**

> **_‚ö´Highlight any interactions with other teams and the process for handover and collaboration._**

### 2. Based on your experience in this project, specify your favorite and least favorite part of this type of collaboration.

R**_emember to keep positive because the interviewers are always looking for constructive answers._**

> **_‚ö´You can specify cutting edge collaboration tools and techniques and/or methodologies that you already know the company employs in their own workflows._**

> **_‚ö´For the least favorite parts, don‚Äôt just list the downsides and failures, but also mention what you‚Äôve learned from it and how you would improve._**

> **_‚ö´ Ensure that you come across humbled from the failures, not exasperated and that you know better than everyone else‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven if you truly feel this way! Explain how you tried to positively encourage your team to correct the course rather than staying silent and going with a consensus majority._**

### **_3. Based on the project, what programming languages / tools / services did you use? And why did you choose¬†them?_**

> **_‚ö´ Questions like this are designed to allow you to showcase your way of thinking. The interviewer is looking to hear your ability to make choices based on rational decisions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso make sure that you show that you can do this!_**

> **_To begin with, give an example of a project in which you had the most ownership or you had the greatest sense of achievement/efficiency/effectiveness from the toolchain used._**

> **_‚ö´ Next, describe the goal of the project, and briefly go through your responsibilities when it came to the toolchain decision-making process. Within Agile work practices, it‚Äôs usually a team effort to decide the best programming languages/tools/services are the best fit for the project, within customer requirements. Outline the consultation process you went through with both the customer and your team to arrive at the best solutions._**

### 4. Describe the biggest toolchain-related challenge you encountered in the¬†project:

> **_‚ö´Outline the situation, the goal you expected, and the reason why there was a challenge._**

> **_‚ö´Share the toolchain you used when you encountered the problem, then other technologies and tools you applied to help solve it, if applicable. Ensure to note whether there was a full tool pivot or you managed to build onto an existing library (or something similar) to achieve the end goal._**

> **_‚ö´Remember: the most important thing is not what you ultimately used, but how many options you referred to during the process, and which metrics you adopted to decide which tech to go for. Remember to share the pros and cons of your decision, and if, looking back now, whether you would do it differently._**

### 5. How would you design this system for¬†scale?

> **_‚ö´First of all, the interviewer would like to know the traffic level we‚Äôre expecting: 1,000, 100,000, or 10 million users per second? Think about the data expectations for each system user, database connections (blocking/nonblocking actions), downtime specifics, and cloud considerations (if any)._**

> **_‚ö´List the potential problems that might occur when trying to scale. Different traffic levels may have different problems, so make sure you think this through, and decide the priorities of the problems that you should solve. Many codebases are not built for scale, so note code changes that might need to occur, rather than just infrastructure expectations._**

> **_‚ö´Different traffic levels may have different system architectures. List the options you think best fit your scenario and explain why you choose them. Many apps utilize a stripped-back product (which can be achieved through system architecture) when high traffic levels affect systems, rather than crashing the product completely or users experiencing unacceptable wait times._**

### 6. Testing: What is your process to test a code when developing a software or application? How do you decide the scope of your test¬†case?

> **_‚ö´First, do your groundwork to ensure that you thoroughly understand the different testing types. Do you know your unit testing from your regression testing from your user acceptance testing? If you need to brush up, check out this great resource._**

> **_‚ö´Once you‚Äôve got that on lock, it‚Äôs time to share a project that you‚Äôve tested thoroughly before._**

> **_‚ö´Remember to separate the project into different sections. Each section should apply the testing type that fits its characteristics. Describe the goals of different testing types, and also introduce the library/service you used for the test. (For bonus points: explain the pros and cons of the library/service and whether it was your decision to choose that particular suite.)_**

> **_‚ö´It makes sense at this point to include documentation (and particularly inline documentation) you use that helps clarify functions/issues so that testing goes smoothly._**

> **_‚ö´You may also mention a project you were involved in where testing was not well conducted and how you would‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor did‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägo about fixing the issues._**

### Monitoring

### 7. What kind of tools / services do you use for logging? What kind of data will you log? And what‚Äôs the next step when you get the¬†log?

> **_‚ö´Time for some details! When answering this question, give an example of a project that you‚Äôve monitored before._**

> **_‚ö´Explain what information you logged and what questions it answered._**

> **_‚ö´Please do not just describe the data format but also give the reason why you decided to extract this data._**

> **_‚ö´Describe the reporting process and any associated tools used._**

> **_‚ö´Some questions to think about to help you structure your answer, and nail your response:_**

---

### What to¬†avoid

> **_‚ö´_**Complaining about having to handle the problem

> **_‚ö´_**Showing how annoyed you were at the problem

> **_‚ö´_**Pointing fingers at others for the problem

> **_‚ö´_**Talking ill of your bosses or coworkers

> ***‚ö´*Keep in mind that your interviewer is not only trying to get a glimpse of your past, but to gain an understanding of how you might react to challenges should they hire you. Therefore, when you‚Äôre choosing your scenario, try to pick one that may be applicable in your new work setting as well.**

---

### NOW; Here‚Äôs some for you guys to answer in the comments!

#### 8. Which logging services have you researched and used¬†before?

#### 9. Why did you choose or look into each particular logging¬†service?

#### 10. Was your decision because of the scale, the features, or the size of the community?

#### 11. In what scenarios did you check these logs? Was it scheduled daily/weekly/monthly or as an on-demand activity?

#### 12. What information would the data be transformed into? Was it for development, business, or customer decision-making?

#### 13. What information would the data be transformed into? Was it for development, business, or customer decision-making?

## [The Best Cloud-Based Code Playgrounds of 2021 (Part¬†1)](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/20/the-best-cloud-based-code-playgrounds-of-2021-part-1/)

#### **A plethora of front-end code playgrounds have appeared over the years. They offer a convenient way to experiment with client-side code and teach/share with others without the hassle of configuring a development environment.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oUZy2IkIQGDbkSVQRGCvKQ.png)

---

### Typical features of these online playgrounds include:

- **_color-coded HTML, CSS and JavaScript editors_**
- **_a preview window‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämany update on the fly without a refresh_**
- **_HTML pre-processors such as HAML_**
- **_LESS, SASS and Stylus CSS pre-processing_**
- **_inclusion of popular JavaScript libraries_**
- **_developer consoles and code validation tools_**
- **_sharing via a short URL_**
- **_embedding demonstrations in other pages_**
- **_code forking_**
- **_zero cost (or payment for premium services only)_**
- **_showing off your coding skills to the world!_**

---

#### The following list is in no particular order and which playground you use is a matter of application and personal taste, they each have their own specialities.

---

### 1.) REPL.IT

### My personal favorite for it‚Äôs simplicity, versatility and capabilities.

### ‚ö´No downloads, no configs, no¬†setups

In your browser. Repl.it runs fully in your browser, so you can get started coding in seconds. No more ZIPs, PKGs, DMGs and WTFs.

> Any OS, any device**_(I‚Äôm looking at you chromebook coders)_**. You can use Repl.it on macOS, Windows, Linux, or any other OS¬†.

### ‚ö´Clone, commit and push to any GitHub¬†repo.

Repl from Repo. Get started with any Github repo, right from your browser. Commit and push without touching your terminal.

### ‚ö´[Markdown Preview](https://blog.replit.com/markdown-preview)

**&gt;A new but fundamentally important feature**

### ‚ö´[No-setup Unit¬†Testing](https://blog.replit.com/unit-tests)

**&gt;Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development & learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. Repl.it now features zero-setup unit testing!**

### ‚ö´[HTTPS by¬†default](https://blog.replit.com/https)

#### In the example below I have 72 solved Javascript Leetcode Problems but REPL.IT can handle almost any language you can think¬†of.

<https://repl.it/@bgoonz/leetcode-level-1>

### Here‚Äôs another one that contains the Repl.it¬†Docs:

<https://replit.com/@bgoonz/replit-docs-1#curriculum/introHTMLCSS.md>

---

### JS-Fiddle

> [**_jsFiddle_**](https://jsfiddle.net/) **_is a cloud-based JavaScript code playground that allows web developers to tweak their code and see the results of this tweaking in real time. The editor supports not only JavaScript and its variants but also HTML and CSS code, and it further supports popular JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery, AngularJS, ReactiveJS and D3. The ad-supported site is also completely free to use._**

### ‚ö´Entering and running¬†code

> JSFiddle has the notion of panels (or tabs if you switch into the tabbed layout), there are 4 panels, 3 where you can enter code, and 1 to see the result.

- **HTML**‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästructure code, no need to add `body` `doctype` `head`, that‚Äôs added automatically
- **CSS**‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästyles. You can switch pre-pocessor to SCSS
- **JavaScript**‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbehavior. There are many frameworks and code pre-processors you can use

Once you enter code, just hit **Run** in the top actions bar, and the fourth panel with results will appear.

### ‚ö´Saving and Forking¬†code

- **Save** / **Update** will do what you think, it‚Äôll save a new fiddle or update an existing one (and add a version number to it)
- **Fork** will split out an existing fiddle into a new one, starting with version 0

<https://jsfiddle.net/bgoonz/L6082jrs/2/>

### StackBlitz

[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/)

- **Installs packages ‚â•5x faster than Yarn & NPM üî•**
- **Reduces the size of** `node_modules` **up to two orders of magnitude üòÆ**
- **Has multiple layers of redundancy for production grade reliability** üí™
- **Works _entirely_ within your web browser, enabling lightning fast dev environments ‚ö°Ô∏è**

> Dependencies still slip into the install process as dev & sub-dependencies and are downloaded & extracted all the same, resulting in the infamous black hole known as `node_modules`:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*-6LsqMPgWtP9NSBl.png)

**Dank, relevant meme (pictured Left)**

**This is the crux of what prevents NPM from working natively in-browser. Resolving, downloading, and extracting the hundreds of megabytes (or gigabytes) typical frontend projects contain in their** `node_modules` **folder is a challenge browsers just aren‚Äôt well suited for. Additionally, this is also why existing server side solutions to this problem have proven to be** [**slow, unreliable**](https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg/issues/35#issuecomment-317128917)

### Glitch

### ‚ö´[**_Glitch_**](https://glitch.com/) ** provides two project templates that you can use to start creating your¬†app:**

1.  **Classic Website**
2.  **Node.js**

If you know the type of project that you would like to create, [click here to get started!](https://glitch.com/create-project) Or keep reading to learn more about the Classic Website and Node.js templates.

### ‚ö´**Classic Website**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AMVRXebQBuww_n_P.png)

The **Classic Website** template is your starting point for creating a **static** website that includes an index.html page and static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Just start typing and your work will be live on the internet! Static websites enjoy unlimited uptime too! This means that your website stays on 24/7 without using your [Project Hours](https://glitch.happyfox.com/kb/article/17/#Uptime).

An existing project will be identified by Glitch as a **static** site if it does not contain one of the following files:

- **package.json**
- **requirements.txt**
- **glitch.json**

### ‚ö´**Node.js**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ppgGuMTHg-YxnImp.png)

If you are looking to build a full-stack JavaScript application, choose the **Node.js** template. This template includes both front-end and back-end code using the popular [Express](https://expressjs.com/) Node.js application framework.

### ‚ö´**Here are some other ways to get started on¬†Glitch‚Ä¶**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*duFOnYTuCHLsfxFi.png)

- Create an app by [importing a GitHub repo](https://glitch.happyfox.com/kb/article/20-can-i-import-code-from-a-github-repository/).
- Build an app that integrates with a popular third-party platform or framework, by remixing [one of these starter templates](https://glitch.com/create).

### Here‚Äôs part one for reference:

<https://bryanguner.medium.com/the-web-developers-technical-interview-e347d7db3822>

- **¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?**

Semantic HTML is markup that conveys meaning, not appearance, to search engines to make everything easier to identify.

- **Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.**

block starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the content.  
¬†inline starts on the same line as previous content, in line with other content, and takes up only the space needed for the content.

¬∑ **What are the 4 areas of the box model?**

content, padding, border, margin

¬∑ **While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?**

cross-axis

¬∑ **Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.**

Allows you to dole out tiny pieces of a large project to many developers who can all work towards the same goal on their own chunks, allows roll back if you make a mistake; version control.

¬∑ **What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**

An adaptive website ‚Äúadapts‚Äù to fit a pre-determined set of screen sizes/devices, and a responsive one changes to fit all devices.

¬∑ **Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**

It means you develop/code the site with mobile in mind first and work your way outward in screen size.

¬∑ **What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?**

This setting makes it so that 1 rem = 10 px for font size, easier to calculate.

¬∑ **How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**

Preprocessing is basically a bunch of functions and variables you can use to store CSS settings in different ways that make it easier to code CSS.

¬∑ **What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**

Favorite is (parametric) mixins; but I don‚Äôt have a lot of trouble with preprocessing. What gives me the most trouble is knowing ahead of time what would be good to go in a mixin for a given site.

¬∑ **Describe the biggest difference between¬†.forEach &¬†.map.**

forEach iterates over an array item by item, and map calls a function on each array item, but returns another/additional array, unlike forEach.

¬∑ **What is the difference between a function and a method?**

Every function is an object. If a value is a function, it is a method. Methods have to be ‚Äòreceived‚Äô by something; functions do not.

¬∑ **What is closure?**

It is code identified elsewhere that we can use later; gives the ability to put functions together. If a variable isn‚Äôt defined, a function looks outward for context.

¬∑ **Describe the four rules of the ‚Äòthis‚Äô keyword.**

1. Window/global binding‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is the window/console object. ‚Äòuse strict‚Äô; to prevent window binding.

2. Implicit binding‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen a function is called by a dot, the object preceding the dot is the ‚Äòthis‚Äô. 80 percent of ‚Äòthis‚Äô is from this type of binding.

3. New binding‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpoints to new object created & returned by constructor function

4. Explicit binding‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhenever call, bind, or apply are used.

¬∑ **Why do we need super() in an extended class?**

Super ties the parent to the child.

- **What is the DOM?**

Document object model, the ‚Äòwindow‚Äô or container that holds all the page‚Äôs elements

- **What is an event?**

An event is something happening on or to the page, like a mouse click, doubleclick, key up/down, pointer out of element/over element, things like this. There are tons of ‚Äúevents‚Äù that javascript can detect.

- **What is an event listener?**

Javascript command that ‚Äòlistens‚Äô for an event to happen on the page to a given element and then runs a function when that event happens

- **Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?**

A NodeList isn‚Äôt a real array, so it won‚Äôt have access to array methods such as slice or map.

- **What is a component?**

Reusable pieces of code to display info in a consistent repeatable way

¬∑ **What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.**

ReactJS is a library used to build large applications. It‚Äôs very good at assisting developers in manipulating the DOM element to create rich user experiences. We need a way to off-load the state/data that our apps use, and React helps us do that.

¬∑ **What does it mean to _think_ in react?**

It makes you think about how to organize/build apps a little differently because it‚Äôs very scalable and allows you to build huge apps. React‚Äôs one-way data flow makes everything modular and fast. You can build apps top-down or bottom-up.

¬∑ **Describe state.**

Some data we want to display.

¬∑ **Describe props.**

Props are like function arguments in JS and attributes in HTML.

¬∑ **What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?**

Side effects are anything that affects something outside the executed function‚Äôs scope like fetching data from an API, a timer, or logging.

¬∑ **Explain benefit(s) using client-side routing?**

Answer: It‚Äôs much more efficient than the traditional way, because a lot of data isn‚Äôt being transmitted unnecessarily.

¬∑ **Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?**

Because some companies still use class components and don‚Äôt want to switch their millions of dollars‚Äô worth of code over to all functional hooks, and also there‚Äôs currently a lot more troubleshooting content out there for classes that isn‚Äôt out there for hooks. Also, functional components are better when you don‚Äôt need state, presentational components.

¬∑ **Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.**

componentDidMount = do the stuff inside this ‚Äòfunction‚Äô after the component mounted

componentDidUpdate = do the stuff inside this function after the component updated

componentWillUnmount = clean-up in death/unmounting phase

¬∑ **What is the purpose of a custom hook?**

allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your components by reusing the same hook over and over again

¬∑ **Why is it important to test our apps?**

Gets bugs fixed faster, reduces regression risk, makes you consider/work out the edge cases, acts as documentation, acts as safety net when refactoring, makes code more trustworthy

¬∑ **What problem does the context API help solve?**

You can store data in a context object instead of prop drilling.

¬∑ **In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a ‚Äòsingle source of truth‚Äô in a redux application?**

Everything that changes within your app is represented by a single JS object called the store. The store contains state for our application. When changes are made to our application state, we never write to our store object but rather clone the state object, modify the clone, and replace the original state with the new copy, never mutating the original object. Reducers are the only place we can update our state. Actions tell our reducers ‚Äúhow‚Äù to update the state, and perhaps with what data it should be updated, but only a reducer can actually update the state.

¬∑ **What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?**

App state is global, component state is local. Use component state when you have component-specific variables.

¬∑ **Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?**

Redux Thunk is middleware that provides the ability to handle asynchronous operations inside our Action Creators, because reducers are normally synchronous.

¬∑ **What is your favorite state management system you‚Äôve learned and this sprint? Please explain why!**

Redux, because I felt it was easier to understand than the context API.

¬∑ **Explain what a token is used for.**

Many services out in the wild require the client (our React app, for example) to provide proof that it‚Äôs authenticated with them. The server running these services can issue a JWT (JSON Web Token) as the authentication token, in exchange for correct login credentials.

¬∑ **What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?**

As we build our web apps, we will most likely have some ‚Äúprotected‚Äù routes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääroutes that we only want to render if the user has logged in and been authenticated by our server. The way this normally works is we make a login request, sending the server the user‚Äôs username and password. The server will check those credentials against what is in the database, and if it can authenticate the user, it will return a token. Once we have this token, we can add two layers of protection to our app. One with protected routes, the other by sending an authentication header with our API calls (as we learned in the above objective).

¬∑ **Describe how web servers work.**

The ‚Äúworld wide web‚Äù (which we‚Äôll refer to as ‚Äúthe web‚Äù) is just a part of the internet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is itself a network of interconnected computers. The web is just one way to share data over the internet. It consists of a body of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared across the world. The term ‚Äúweb server‚Äù can mean two things:

¬∑ a computer that stores the code for a website

¬∑ a program that runs on such a computer

The physical computer device that we call a web server is connected to the internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across the world at all times. When we load the code for our websites, or web apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is ‚Äúhosting‚Äù our website/app.

¬∑ **Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.**

Create, Read, Update, Delete

¬∑ **Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.**

Routing/router, Middleware, convenience helpers

¬∑ **Describe Middleware?**

array of functions that get executed in the order they are introduced into the server code

¬∑ **Describe a Resource?**

o everything is a **resource**.

o each resource is accessible via a **unique URI**.

o resources can have multiple **representations**.

o communication is done over a **stateless** protocol (HTTP).

o management of resources is done via **HTTP methods**.

¬∑ **What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?**

200 status code/201 status code

¬∑ **How can we partition our application into sub-applications?**

By dividing the code up into multiple files and ‚Äòrequiring‚Äô them in the main server file.

¬∑ **Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.**

SQL is the language used to access a relational database.

¬∑ **Why do tables need a primary key?**

To uniquely identify each record/row.

¬∑ **What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.**

Foreign key

¬∑ **What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.**

An **intermediary table** that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables.

¬∑ **What is the purpose of using _sessions_?**

The purpose is to persist data across requests.

¬∑ **What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner?**

o password hashing function.

o implements salting both manual and automatically.

o accumulative hashing rounds.

¬∑ **What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?**

Having an algorithm that hashes the information multiple times (rounds) means an attacker needs to have the hash, know the algorithm used, and how many rounds were used to generate the hash in the first place. So it basically makes it a lot more difficult to get somebody‚Äôs password.

¬∑ **What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?**

Header, payload, signature

### Asymptotic Notation

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rHF5Jb6Cv_vxiZKg06Abtg.png)

### Definition:

Asymptotic Notation is the hardware independent notation used to tell the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Meaning it‚Äôs a standardized way of measuring how much memory an algorithm uses or how long it runs for given an input.

#### Complexities

The following are the Asymptotic rates of growth from best to worst:

- constant growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(1)` Runtime is constant and does not grow with `n`
- logarithmic growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(log n)` Runtime grows logarithmically in proportion to `n`
- linear growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(n)` Runtime grows directly in proportion to `n`
- superlinear growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(n log n)` Runtime grows in proportion _and_ logarithmically to `n`
- polynomial growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(n^c)` Runtime grows quicker than previous all based on `n`
- exponential growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(c^n)` Runtime grows even faster than polynomial growth based on `n`
- factorial growth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`O(n!)` Runtime grows the fastest and becomes quickly unusable for even  
  small values of `n`

[(source: Wikipedia, _Computational Complexity of Mathematical Operations_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations)

#### Big-O notation

Big-O refers to the upper bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it worst case runtime scenario. An easy way to think of it is that runtime could be better than Big-O but it will never be worse.

#### Big-Œ© (Big-Omega) notation

Big-Omega refers to the lower bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm, meaning it is the best runtime scenario. Or runtime could worse than Big-Omega, but it will never be better.

#### Big-Œ∏ (Big-Theta) notation

Big-Theta refers to the tight bound of time or space complexity of an algorithm. Another way to think of it is the intersection of Big-O and Big-Omega, or more simply runtime is guaranteed to be a given complexity, such as `n log n`.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Big-O and Big-Theta are the most common and helpful notations
- Big-O does _not_ mean Worst Case Scenario, Big-Theta does _not_ mean average case, and Big-Omega does _not_ mean Best Case Scenario. They only connote the algorithm‚Äôs performance for a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.
- Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.
- Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an upper bound.
- Big-O isn‚Äôt everything. On paper merge sort is faster than quick sort, but in practice quick sort is superior.

### Data Structures

### Array

#### Definition

- Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0 based, index.
- Based on [tuples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple) from set theory.
- They are one of the oldest, most commonly used data structures.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end).
- **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.
- Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.
- **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.
- If a dynamic array is full, it copies its contents to a larger array.
- **Multi dimensional arrays** nested arrays that allow for multiple dimensions such as an array of arrays providing a 2 dimensional spacial representation via x, y coordinates.

#### Time Complexity

- Indexing: Linear array: `O(1)`, Dynamic array: `O(1)`
- Search: Linear array: `O(n)`, Dynamic array: `O(n)`
- Optimized Search: Linear array: `O(log n)`, Dynamic array: `O(log n)`
- Insertion: Linear array: n/a, Dynamic array: `O(n)`

### Linked List

#### Definition

- Stores data with **nodes** that point to other nodes.
- Nodes, at its most basic it has one datum and one reference (another node).
- A linked list _chains_ nodes together by pointing one node‚Äôs reference towards another node.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Designed to optimize insertion and deletion, slow at indexing and searching.
- **Doubly linked list** has nodes that also reference the previous node.
- **Circularly linked list** is simple linked list whose **tail**, the last node, references the **head**, the first node.
- **Stack**, commonly implemented with linked lists but can be made from arrays too.
- Stacks are **last in, first out** (LIFO) data structures.
- Made with a linked list by having the head be the only place for insertion and removal.
- **Queues**, too can be implemented with a linked list or an array.
- Queues are a **first in, first out** (FIFO) data structure.
- Made with a doubly linked list that only removes from head and adds to tail.

#### Time Complexity

- Indexing: Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Search: Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Optimized Search: Linked Lists: `O(n)`
- Append: Linked Lists: `O(1)`
- Prepend: Linked Lists: `O(1)`
- Insertion: Linked Lists: `O(n)`

### Hash Table or Hash¬†Map

#### Definition

- Stores data with key value pairs.
- **Hash functions** accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key.
- This is known as **hashing**, which is the concept that an input and an output have a one-to-one correspondence to map information.
- Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Designed to optimize searching, insertion, and deletion.
- **Hash collisions** are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs.
- All hash functions have this problem.
- This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large.
- Hashes are important for associative arrays and database indexing.

#### Time Complexity

- Indexing: Hash Tables: `O(1)`
- Search: Hash Tables: `O(1)`
- Insertion: Hash Tables: `O(1)`

### Binary Tree

#### Definition

- Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children.
- There is one left and right child node.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
- A **degenerate tree** is an unbalanced tree, which if entirely one-sided, is essentially a linked list.
- They are comparably simple to implement than other data structures.
- Used to make **binary search trees**.
- A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child is.
- Left child has a key smaller than its parent node.
- Right child has a key greater than its parent node.
- There can be no duplicate node.
- Because of the above it is more likely to be used as a data structure than a binary tree.

#### Time Complexity

- Indexing: Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
- Search: Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`
- Insertion: Binary Search Tree: `O(log n)`

### Algorithms

### Algorithm Basics

### Recursive Algorithms

#### Definition

- An algorithm that calls itself in its definition.
- **Recursive case** a conditional statement that is used to trigger the recursion.
- **Base case** a conditional statement that is used to break the recursion.

#### What you need to¬†know

- **Stack level too deep** and **stack overflow**.
- If you‚Äôve seen either of these from a recursive algorithm, you messed up.
- It means that your base case was never triggered because it was faulty or the problem was so massive you ran out of alloted memory.
- Knowing whether or not you will reach a base case is integral to correctly using recursion.
- Often used in Depth First Search

### Iterative Algorithms

#### Definition

- An algorithm that is called repeatedly but for a finite number of times, each time being a single iteration.
- Often used to move incrementally through a data set.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Generally you will see iteration as loops, for, while, and until statements.
- Think of iteration as moving one at a time through a set.
- Often used to move through an array.

#### Recursion Vs. Iteration

- The differences between recursion and iteration can be confusing to distinguish since both can be used to implement the other. But know that,
- Recursion is, usually, more expressive and easier to implement.
- Iteration uses less memory.
- **Functional languages** tend to use recursion. (i.e. Haskell)
- **Imperative languages** tend to use iteration. (i.e. Ruby)
- Check out this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19794739/what-is-the-difference-between-iteration-and-recursion) for more info.

#### Pseudo Code of Moving Through an¬†Array

    recursive method (array, n)       | iterative method (array)
      if array[n] is not nil          |   for n from 0 to size of array
        print array[n]                |     print(array[n])
        recursive method(array, n+1)  |
      else                            |
        exit loop                     |

### Greedy Algorithms

#### Definition

- An algorithm that, while executing, selects only the information that meets a certain criteria.
- The general five components, taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm#Specifics):
- A candidate set, from which a solution is created.
- A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution.
- A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution.
- An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution.
- A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Used to find the expedient, though non-optimal, solution for a given problem.
- Generally used on sets of data where only a small proportion of the information evaluated meets the desired result.
- Often a greedy algorithm can help reduce the Big O of an algorithm.

#### Pseudo Code of a Greedy Algorithm to Find Largest Difference of any Two Numbers in an¬†Array.

    greedy algorithm (array)
      let largest difference = 0
      let new difference = find next difference (array[n], array[n+1])
      largest difference = new difference if new difference is > largest difference
      repeat above two steps until all differences have been found
      return largest difference

This algorithm never needed to compare all the differences to one another, saving it an entire iteration.

### Search Algorithms

### Breadth First¬†Search

#### Definition

- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching levels of the tree first, starting at the root.
- It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left to right.
- While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current level.
- When finished examining a level it moves to the left most node on the next level.
- The bottom-right most node is evaluated last (the node that is deepest and is farthest right of it‚Äôs level).

#### What you need to¬†know

- Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than it is deep.
- Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.
- Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than **depth first search**.
- The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores pointers

#### Time Complexity

- Search: Breadth First Search: O(V + E)
- E is number of edges
- V is number of vertices

### Depth First¬†Search

#### Definition

- An algorithm that searches a tree (or graph) by searching depth of the tree first, starting at the root.
- It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go further.
- Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right child of nodes on that branch, and if possible left from the right children.
- When finished examining a branch it moves to the node right of the root then tries to go left on all it‚Äôs children until it reaches the bottom.
- The right most node is evaluated last (the node that is right of all it‚Äôs ancestors).

#### What you need to¬†know

- Optimal for searching a tree that is deeper than it is wide.
- Uses a stack to push nodes onto.
- Because a stack is LIFO it does not need to keep track of the nodes pointers and is therefore less memory intensive than breadth first search.
- Once it cannot go further left it begins evaluating the stack.

#### Time Complexity

- Search: Depth First Search: O(|E| + |V|)
- E is number of edges
- V is number of vertices

#### Breadth First Search Vs. Depth First¬†Search

- The simple answer to this question is that it depends on the size and shape of the tree.
- For wide, shallow trees use Breadth First Search
- For deep, narrow trees use Depth First Search

#### Nuances

- Because BFS uses queues to store information about the nodes and its children, it could use more memory than is available on your computer. (But you probably won‚Äôt have to worry about this.)
- If using a DFS on a tree that is very deep you might go unnecessarily deep in the search. See [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/761/) for more information.
- Breadth First Search tends to be a looping algorithm.
- Depth First Search tends to be a recursive algorithm.

### Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort

#### Definition

- A comparison based sorting algorithm.
- Starts with the cursor on the left, iterating left to right
- Compares the left side to the right, looking for the smallest known item
- If the left is smaller than the item to the right it continues iterating
- If the left is bigger than the item to the right, the item on the right becomes the known smallest number
- Once it has checked all items, it moves the known smallest to the cursor and advances the cursor to the right and starts over
- As the algorithm processes the data set, it builds a fully sorted left side of the data until the entire data set is sorted
- Changes the array in place.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Inefficient for large data sets.
- Very simple to implement.

#### Time Complexity

- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: `O(n^2)`
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: `O(n^2)`
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: `O(n^2)`

#### Space Complexity

- Worst Case: `O(1)`

#### Visualization

[(source: Wikipedia, _Insertion Sort_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

### Insertion Sort

#### Definition

- A comparison based sorting algorithm.
- Iterates left to right comparing the current cursor to the previous item.
- If the cursor is smaller than the item on the left it swaps positions and the cursor compares itself again to the left hand side until it is put in its sorted position.
- As the algorithm processes the data set, the left side becomes increasingly sorted until it is fully sorted.
- Changes the array in place.

#### What you need to¬†know

- Inefficient for large data sets, but can be faster for than other algorithms for small ones.
- Although it has an `O(n^2)`, in practice it slightly less since its comparison scheme only requires checking place if its smaller than its neighbor.

#### Time Complexity

- Best Case: `O(n)`
- Average Case: `O(n^2)`
- Worst Case: `O(n^2)`

#### Space Complexity

- Worst Case: `O(n)`

#### Visualization

[(source: Wikipedia, _Insertion Sort_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)

### Merge Sort

#### Definition

- A divide and conquer algorithm.
- Recursively divides entire array by half into subsets until the subset is one, the base case.
- Once the base case is reached results are returned and sorted ascending left to right.
- Recursive calls are returned and the sorts double in size until the entire array is sorted.

#### What you need to¬†know

- This is one of the fundamental sorting algorithms.
- Know that it divides all the data into as small possible sets then compares them.

#### Time Complexity

- Worst Case: `O(n log n)`
- Average Case: `O(n log n)`
- Best Case: `O(n)`

#### Space Complexity

- Worst Case: `O(1)`

[(source: Wikipedia, _Merge Sort_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)

### Quicksort

#### Definition

- A divide and conquer algorithm
- Partitions entire data set in half by selecting a random pivot element and putting all smaller elements to the left of the element and larger ones to the right.
- It repeats this process on the left side until it is comparing only two elements at which point the left side is sorted.
- When the left side is finished sorting it performs the same operation on the right side.
- Computer architecture favors the quicksort process.
- Changes the array in place.

#### What you need to¬†know

- While it has the same Big O as (or worse in some cases) many other sorting algorithms it is often faster in practice than many other sorting algorithms, such as merge sort.

#### Time Complexity

- Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
- Average Case: `O(n log n)`
- Best Case: `O(n log n)`

#### Space Complexity

- Worst Case: `O(log n)`

#### Visualization

[(source: Wikipedia, _Quicksort_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

#### Merge Sort Vs. Quicksort

- Quicksort is likely faster in practice, but merge sort is faster on paper.
- Merge Sort divides the set into the smallest possible groups immediately then reconstructs the incrementally as it sorts the groupings.
- Quicksort continually partitions the data set by a pivot, until the set is recursively sorted.

### What is ARIA and when should you use¬†it?

#### Answer

ARIA stands for ‚ÄúAccessible Rich Internet Applications‚Äù, and is a technical specification created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Better known as WAI-ARIA, it provides additional HTML attributes in the development of web applications to offer people who use assistive technologies (AT) a more robust and interoperable experience with dynamic components. By providing the component‚Äôs role, name, and state, AT users can better understand how to interact with the component. WAI-ARIA should only be used when an HTML element equivalent is not available or lacks full browser or AT support. WAI-ARIA‚Äôs semantic markup coupled with JavaScript works to provide an understandable and interactive experience for people who use AT.

An example using ARIA:

    <div
      role="combobox"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-owns="ex1-grid"
      aria-haspopup="grid"
      id="ex1-combobox">
      ...
    </div>

### What is the minimum recommended ratio of contrast between foreground text and background to comply with WCAG? Why does this¬†matter?

#### Answer

4.5:1 is the calculated contrast ratio between foreground text and background that is recommended by the Web Content Accessibiity Guidelines (WCAG) success criteria (SC) 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum). This SC was written by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that people with low vision or color deficiencies are able to read (perceive) important content on a web page. It goes beyond color choices to ensure text stands out on the background it‚Äôs placed on.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- At least 4.5:1 contrast ratio between foreground text and background
- Benefits people with low vision or color deficiencies

### What are some of the tools available to test the accessibility of a website or web application?

#### Answer

There are multiple tools that can help you to find for accessibility issues in your website or application.

Check for issues in your website:

- Lighthouse from Google, it provides an option for accessibility testing, it will check for the compliance of different accessibility standards and give you an score with details on the different issues
- Axe Coconut from DequeLabs, it is a Chrome extension that adds a tab in the Developer tools, it will check for accessibility issues and it will classify them by severity and suggest possible solutions

Check for issues in your code: \* Jest Axe, you can add unit tests for accessibility \* React Axe, test your React application with the axe-core accessibility testing library. Results will show in the Chrome DevTools console. \* eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, pairing this plugin with an editor lint plugin, you can bake accessibility standards into your application in real-time.

Check for individual issues: \* Color Contrast checkers \* Use a screen reader \* Use only keyboard to navigate your site

### What is the Accessibility Tree?

#### Answer

The Accessibility Tree is a structure produced by the browser‚Äôs Accessibility APIs which provides accessibility information to assistive technologies such as screen readers. It runs parallel to the DOM and is similar to the DOM API, but with much fewer nodes, because a lot of that information is only useful for visual presentation. By writing semantic HTML we can take advantage of this process in creating an accessible experience for our users.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Tree structure exposing information to assistive technologies
- Runs parallel to the DOM
- Semantic HTML is essential in creating accessible experiences

### What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on¬†images?

#### Answer

The `alt` attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. The `alt` attribute should be used to describe any images except those which only serve a decorative purpose, in which case it should be left empty.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Decorative images should have an empty `alt` attribute.
- Web crawlers use `alt` tags to understand image content, so they are considered important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
- Put the¬†`.` at the end of `alt` tag to improve accessibility.

### What are `defer` and `async` attributes on a `<script>`¬†tag?

#### Answer

If neither attribute is present, the script is downloaded and executed synchronously, and will halt parsing of the document until it has finished executing (default behavior). Scripts are downloaded and executed in the order they are encountered.

The `defer` attribute downloads the script while the document is still parsing but waits until the document has finished parsing before executing it, equivalent to executing inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. `defer` scripts will execute in order.

The `async` attribute downloads the script during parsing the document but will pause the parser to execute the script before it has fully finished parsing. `async` scripts will not necessarily execute in order.

Note: both attributes must only be used if the script has a `src` attribute (i.e. not an inline script).

    <script src="myscript.js"></script>
    http://myscript.js
    http://myscript.js

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Placing a `defer` script in the `<head>` allows the browser to download the script while the page is still parsing, and is therefore a better option than placing the script before the end of the body.
- If the scripts rely on each other, use `defer`.
- If the script is independent, use `async`.
- Use `defer` if the DOM must be ready and the contents are not placed within a `DOMContentLoaded` listener.

### What is an `async` function?

    async function foo() {
      ...
    }

#### Answer

An `async` function is a function that allows you to pause the function‚Äôs execution while it waits for (`await`s) a promise to resolve. It‚Äôs an abstraction on top of the Promise API that makes asynchronous operations _look_ like they‚Äôre synchronous.

`async` functions automatically return a Promise object. Whatever you `return` from the `async` function will be the promise‚Äôs _resolution_. If instead you `throw` from the body of an `async` function, that will be how your async function _rejects_ the promise it returns.

Most importantly, `async` functions are able to use the `await` keyword in their function body, which **pauses the function** until the operation after the `await` completes, and allows it to return that operation‚Äôs result to a variable synchronously.

    // Normal promises in regular function:
    function foo() {
      promiseCall()
        .then(result => {
          // do something with the result
        })
    }

    // async functions
    async function foo() {
      const result = await promiseCall()
      // do something with the result
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- `async` functions are just syntactic sugar on top of Promises.
- They make asynchronous operations look like synchronous operations in your function.
- They implicitly return a promise which resolves to whatever your `async` function returns, and reject to whatever your `async` function `throw`s.

### Create a function `batches` that returns the maximum number of whole batches that can be cooked from a¬†recipe.

    /**
    It accepts two objects as arguments: the first object is the recipe
    for the food, while the second object is the available ingredients.
    Each ingredient's value is a number representing how many units there are.

    `batches(recipe, available)`
    */

    // 0 batches can be made
    batches(
      { milk: 100, butter: 50, flour: 5 },
      { milk: 132, butter: 48, flour: 51 }
    )
    batches(
      { milk: 100, flour: 4, sugar: 10, butter: 5 },
      { milk: 1288, flour: 9, sugar: 95 }
    )

    // 1 batch can be made
    batches(
      { milk: 100, butter: 50, cheese: 10 },
      { milk: 198, butter: 52, cheese: 10 }
    )

    // 2 batches can be made
    batches(
      { milk: 2, sugar: 40, butter: 20 },
      { milk: 5, sugar: 120, butter: 500 }
    )

#### Answer

We must have all ingredients of the recipe available, and in quantities that are more than or equal to the number of units required. If just one of the ingredients is not available or lower than needed, we cannot make a single batch.

Use `Object.keys()` to return the ingredients of the recipe as an array, then use `Array.prototype.map()` to map each ingredient to the ratio of available units to the amount required by the recipe. If one of the ingredients required by the recipe is not available at all, the ratio will evaluate to `NaN`, so the logical OR operator can be used to fallback to `0` in this case.

Use the spread¬†`...` operator to feed the array of all the ingredient ratios into `Math.min()` to determine the lowest ratio. Passing this entire result into `Math.floor()` rounds down to return the maximum number of whole batches.

    const batches = (recipe, available) =>
      Math.floor(
        Math.min(...Object.keys(recipe).map(k => available[k] / recipe[k] || 0))
      )

### What is CSS¬†BEM?

#### Answer

The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a ‚Äúnamespace‚Äù for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.

    /* block component */
    .block {
    }

    /* element */
    .block__element {
    }

    /* modifier */
    .block__element--modifier {
    }

Here is an example with the class names on markup:

    <nav class="navbar">
      <a href="/" class="navbar__link navbar__link--active"></a>
      <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
      <a href="/" class="navbar__link"></a>
    </nav>

In this case, `navbar` is the Block, `navbar__link` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the `navbar` component, and `navbar__link--active` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the `navbar__link` Element.

Since Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use `is-*` flags instead as modifiers.

    <a href="/" class="navbar__link is-active"></a>

These must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.

    .navbar__link.is-active {
    }

### What is Big O Notation?

#### Answer

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest and have the simplest complexity.

Algorithms don‚Äôt always perform the same and may vary based on the data they are supplied. While in some cases they will execute quickly, in other cases they will execute slowly, even with the same number of elements to deal with.

In these examples, the base time is 1 element = `1ms`.

O(1)

    arr[arr.length - 1]

- 1000 elements = `1ms`

Constant time complexity. No matter how many elements the array has, it will theoretically take (excluding real-world variation) the same amount of time to execute.

O(N)

    arr.filter(fn)

- 1000 elements = `1000ms`

Linear time complexity. The execution time will increase linearly with the number of elements the array has. If the array has 1000 elements and the function takes 1ms to execute, 7000 elements will take 7ms to execute. This is because the function must iterate through all elements of the array before returning a result.

O(\[1, N\])

    arr.some(fn)

- 1000 elements = `1ms <= x <= 1000ms`

The execution time varies depending on the data supplied to the function, it may return very early or very late. The best case here is O(1) and the worst case is O(N).

O(NlogN)

    arr.sort(fn)

- 1000 elements ~= `10000ms`

Browsers usually implement the quicksort algorithm for the `sort()` method and the average time complexity of quicksort is O(NlgN). This is very efficient for large collections.

O(N¬≤)

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
        // ...
      }
    }

- 1000 elements = `1000000ms`

The execution time rises quadratically with the number of elements. Usually the result of nesting loops.

O(N!)

    const permutations = arr => {
      if (arr.length <= 2) return arr.length === 2 ? [arr, [arr[1], arr[0]]] : arr
      return arr.reduce(
        (acc, item, i) =>
          acc.concat(
            permutations([...arr.slice(0, i), ...arr.slice(i + 1)]).map(val => [
              item,
              ...val
            ])
          ),
        []
      )
    }

- 1000 elements = `Infinity` (practically) ms

The execution time rises extremely fast with even just 1 addition to the array.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Be wary of nesting loops as execution time increases exponentially.

### Create a standalone function `bind` that is functionally equivalent to the method `Function.prototype.bind`.

    function example() {
      console.log(this)
    }
    const boundExample = bind(example, { a: true })
    boundExample.call({ b: true }) // logs { a: true }

#### Answer

Return a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments by gathering them with the rest¬†`...` operator. From that function, return the result of calling the `fn` with `Function.prototype.apply` to apply the context and the array of arguments to the function.

    const bind = (fn, context) => (...args) => fn.apply(context, args)

### What is the purpose of cache busting and how can you achieve¬†it?

#### Answer

Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don‚Äôt need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.

However, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user‚Äôs cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.

Cache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.

A common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.

- `src="js/script.js"` =&gt; `src="js/script.js?v=2"`

The browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.

### How can you avoid callback¬†hells?

    getData(function(a) {
      getMoreData(a, function(b) {
        getMoreData(b, function(c) {
          getMoreData(c, function(d) {
            getMoreData(d, function(e) {
              // ...
            })
          })
        })
      })
    })

#### Answer

Refactoring the functions to return promises and using `async/await` is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be `await`ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.

The above code can be restructured like so:

    async function asyncAwaitVersion() {
      const a = await getData()
      const b = await getMoreData(a)
      const c = await getMoreData(b)
      const d = await getMoreData(c)
      const e = await getMoreData(d)
      // ...
    }

There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:

- Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions
- Use a control flow library, like async
- Use generators with Promises
- Use async/await (from v7 on)

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- As an efficient JavaScript developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.

### What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of `setState`?

#### Answer

The callback function is invoked when `setState` has finished and the component gets rendered. Since `setState` is asynchronous, the callback function is used for any post action.

    setState({ name: "sudheer" }, () => {
      console.log("The name has updated and component re-rendered")
    })

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- The callback function is invoked after `setState` finishes and is used for any post action.
- It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather this callback function.

### Which is the preferred option between callback refs and findDOMNode()?

#### Answer

Callback refs are preferred over the `findDOMNode()` API, due to the fact that `findDOMNode()` prevents certain improvements in React in the future.

    // Legacy approach using findDOMNode()
    class MyComponent extends Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        findDOMNode(this).scrollIntoView()
      }

      render() {
        return <div />
      }
    }

    // Recommended approach using callback refs
    class MyComponent extends Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        this.node.scrollIntoView()
      }

      render() {
        return <div ref={node => (this.node = node)} />
      }
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Callback refs are preferred over `findDOMNode()`.

### What is a callback? Can you show an example using¬†one?

#### Answer

Callbacks are functions passed as an argument to another function to be executed once an event has occurred or a certain task is complete, often used in asynchronous code. Callback functions are invoked later by a piece of code but can be declared on initialization without being invoked.

As an example, event listeners are asynchronous callbacks that are only executed when a specific event occurs.

    function onClick() {
      console.log("The user clicked on the page.")
    }
    document.addEventListener("click",
        onClick)

However, callbacks can also be synchronous. The following `map` function takes a callback function that is invoked synchronously for each iteration of the loop (array element).

    const map = (arr, callback) => {
      const result = []
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        result.push(callback(arr[i], i))
      }
      return result
    }
    map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n => n * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Callbacks vs Promises

### What is the `children`¬†prop?

#### Answer

`children` is part of the props object passed to components that allows components to be passed as data to other components, providing the ability to compose components cleanly. There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop, such as `React.Children.map`, `React.Children.forEach`, `React.Children.count`, `React.Children.only` and `React.Children.toArray`. A simple usage example of the children prop is as follows:

    function GenericBox({ children }) {
      return <div className="container">{children}</div>
    }

    function App() {
      return (
        <GenericBox>
          <span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
        </GenericBox>
      )
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Children is a prop that allows components to be passed as data to other components.
- The React API provides methods to work with this prop.

### Why does React use `className` instead of `class` like in¬†HTML?

#### Answer

React‚Äôs philosophy in the beginning was to align with the browser DOM API rather than HTML, since that more closely represents how elements are created. Setting a `class` on an element meant using the `className` API:

    const element = document.createElement("div")
    element.className = "hello"

Additionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:

    const element = {
      attributes: {
        class: "hello"
      }
    }

In IE8, this will throw an error.

In modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to assign to a variable:

    const { class } = this.props // Error
    const { className } = this.props // All good
    const { class: className } =
        this.props // All good, but
            cumbersome!

However, `class` _can_ be used as a prop without problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows you to use `class`, but will throw a warning and convert it to `className` under the hood. There is currently an open thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing `className` to `class` to reduce confusion.

### How do you clone an object in JavaScript?

#### Answer

Using the object spread operator¬†`...`, the object‚Äôs own enumerable properties can be copied into the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.

    const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
    const shallowClone = { ...obj }

With this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.

Other alternatives include:

- `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).
- `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.
- `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- JavaScript passes objects by reference, meaning that nested objects get their references copied, instead of their values.
- The same method can be used to merge two objects.

### What is a closure? Can you give a useful example of¬†one?

#### Answer

A closure is a function defined inside another function and has access to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:

- Variables declared in its own scope
- Variables declared in the scope of the parent function
- Variables declared in the global scope

In JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don‚Äôt utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.

In addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can‚Äôt be accessed from the outside in JavaScript. They are the key to the UMD (Universal Module Definition) pattern, which is frequently used in libraries that only expose a public API but keep the implementation details private, preventing name collisions with other libraries or the user‚Äôs own code.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data.
- A closure can substitute an object with only a single method.
- Closures can be used to emulate private properties and methods.

### How do you compare two objects in JavaScript?

#### Answer

Even though two different objects can have the same properties with equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using `==` or `===`. This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.

In order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will iterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects. Optionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing `true` as the 3rd argument.

Note: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than plain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.

    function isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {
      if (obj1 === obj2) {
        return true
      }

      if (typeof obj1 === "function" && typeof obj2 === "function") {
        return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString()
      }

      if (obj1 instanceof Date && obj2 instanceof Date) {
        return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime()
      }

      if (
        Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) !==
          Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) ||
        typeof obj1 !== "object"
      ) {
        return false
      }

      const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes
        ? isDeepEqual(
            Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1),
            Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2),
            true
          )
        : true

      const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1)
      const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2)

      return (
        obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &&
        prototypesAreEqual &&
        obj1Props.every(prop => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]))
      )
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Primitives like strings and numbers are compared by their value
- Objects on the other hand are compared by their reference (location in memory)

### What is¬†context?

#### Answer

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.

    const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue)

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Context provides a way to pass data through a tree of React components, without having to manually pass props.
- Context is designed to share data that is considered _global_ for a tree of React components.

### What is¬†CORS?

#### Answer

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to grant a browser permission to access resources from a server at an origin different from the website origin.

An example of a cross-origin request is a web application served from `http://mydomain.com` that uses AJAX to make a request for `http://yourdomain.com`[.](http://yourdomain.com./)

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by JavaScript. `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` follow the same-origin policy, meaning a web application using those APIs can only request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was accessed, unless the response from the other origin includes the correct CORS headers.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- CORS behavior is not an error, it‚Äôs a security mechanism to protect users.
- CORS is designed to prevent a malicious website that a user may unintentionally visit from making a request to a legitimate website to read their personal data or perform actions against their will.

### Describe the layout of the CSS Box Model and briefly describe each component.

#### Answer

`Content`: The inner-most part of the box filled with content, such as text, an image, or video player. It has the dimensions `content-box width` and `content-box height`.

`Padding`: The transparent area surrounding the content. It has dimensions `padding-box width` and `padding-box height`.

`Border`: The area surrounding the padding (if any) and content. It has dimensions `border-box width` and `border-box height`.

_Margin_: The transparent outer-most layer that surrounds the border. It separates the element from other elements in the DOM. It has dimensions `margin-box width` and `margin-box height`.

### What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors?

#### Answer

CSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not have, and generally make CSS neater and more maintainable by enabling DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principles. Their terse syntax for nested selectors cuts down on repeated code. They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this functionality) and additional tools like color functions (`lighten`, `darken`, `transparentize`, etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the developer more power to generate complex CSS.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- They allow us to write more maintainable and scalable CSS
- Some disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors (setup, re-compilation time can be slow etc.)

### What is the difference between ‚Äò+‚Äô and ‚Äò~‚Äô sibling selectors?.

#### Answer

The General Sibling Selector `~` selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.

The following example selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of `<div>` elements:

    div ~ p {
      background-color: blue;
    }

The Adjacent Sibling Selector `+` selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.

The following example will select all `<p>` elements that are placed immediately after `<div>` elements:

    div + p {
      background-color: red;
    }

### Can you describe how CSS specificity works?

#### Answer

Assuming the browser has already determined the set of rules for an element, each rule is assigned a matrix of values, which correspond to the following from highest to lowest specificity:

- Inline rules (binary‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää1 or 0)
- Number of id selectors
- Number of class, pseudo-class and attribute selectors
- Number of tags and pseudo-element selectors

When two selectors are compared, the comparison is made on a per-column basis (e.g. an id selector will always be higher than any amount of class selectors, as ids have higher specificity than classes). In cases of equal specificity between multiple rules, the rules that comes last in the page‚Äôs style sheet is deemed more specific and therefore applied to the element.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Specificity matrix: \[inline, id, class/pseudo-class/attribute, tag/pseudo-element\]
- In cases of equal specificity, last rule is applied

### What is debouncing?

#### Answer

Debouncing is a process to add some delay before executing a function. It is commonly used with DOM event listeners to improve the performance of page. It is a technique which allow us to ‚Äúgroup‚Äù multiple sequential calls in a single one. A raw DOM event listeners can easily trigger 20+ events per second. A debounced function will only be called once the delay has passed.

    const debounce = (func, delay) => {
      let debounceTimer;
      return function() {
        const context = this;
        const args = arguments;
          clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
            debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(context, args), delay);
      }
    }

    window.addEventListere('scroll', debounce(function() {
      // Do stuff, this function will be called after a delay of 1 second
    }, 1000));

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Common use case is to make API call only when user is finished typing while searching.

### What is the¬†DOM?

#### Answer

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a cross-platform API that treats HTML and XML documents as a tree structure consisting of nodes. These nodes (such as elements and text nodes) are objects that can be programmatically manipulated and any visible changes made to them are reflected live in the document. In a browser, this API is available to JavaScript where DOM nodes can be manipulated to change their styles, contents, placement in the document, or interacted with through event listeners.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
- The DOM is constructed progressively in the browser as a page loads, which is why scripts are often placed at the bottom of a page, in the `<head>` with a `defer` attribute, or inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. Scripts that manipulate DOM nodes should be run after the DOM has been constructed to avoid errors.
- `document.getElementById()` and `document.querySelector()` are common functions for selecting DOM nodes.
- Setting the `innerHTML` property to a new value runs the string through the HTML parser, offering an easy way to append dynamic HTML content to a node.

### What is the difference between the equality operators `==` and¬†`===`?

#### Answer

Triple equals (`===`) checks for strict equality, which means both the type and value must be the same. Double equals (`==`) on the other hand first performs type coercion so that both operands are of the same type and then applies strict comparison.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Whenever possible, use triple equals to test equality because loose equality `==` can have unintuitive results.
- Type coercion means the values are converted into the same type.
- Mention of falsy values and their comparison.

### What is the difference between an element and a component in¬†React?

#### Answer

An element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM node or component. Elements are pure and never mutated, and are cheap to create.

A component is a function or class. Components can have state and take props as input and return an element tree as output (although they can represent generic containers or wrappers and don‚Äôt necessarily have to emit DOM). Components can initiate side effects in lifecycle methods (e.g. AJAX requests, DOM mutations, interfacing with 3rd party libraries) and may be expensive to create.

    const Component = () => "Hello"
    const componentElement = <Component />
    const domNodeElement = <div />

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Elements are immutable, plain objects that describe the DOM nodes or components you want to render.
- Components can be either classes or functions, that take props as an input and return an element tree as the output.

### What is the difference between `em` and `rem`¬†units?

#### Answer

Both `em` and `rem` units are based on the `font-size` CSS property. The only difference is where they inherit their values from.

- `em` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the parent element
- `rem` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the root element (`html`)

In most browsers, the `font-size` of the root element is set to `16px` by default.

### What are error boundaries in¬†React?

#### Answer

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

Class components become error boundaries if they define either (or both) of the lifecycle methods `static getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch().`

    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = { hasError: false }
      }

      // Use componentDidCatch to log the error
      componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
        logErrorToMyService(error, info)
      }

      // use getDerivedStateFromError to update state
      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // Display fallback UI
         return { hasError: true };
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          // You can render any custom fallback UI
          return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>
        }
        return this.props.children
      }
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree. An error boundary can‚Äôt catch an error within itself.

### What is event delegation and why is it useful? Can you show an example of how to use¬†it?

#### Answer

Event delegation is a technique of delegating events to a single common ancestor. Due to event bubbling, events ‚Äúbubble‚Äù up the DOM tree by executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the root that may be listening to it.

DOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated the event via `Event.target`. This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.

This provides two main benefits:

- It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.
- If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.

Instead of:

    document.querySelectorAll("button").forEach(button => {
      button.addEventListener("click", handleButtonClick)
    })

Event delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:

    document.addEventListener("click", e => {
      if (e.target.closest("button")) {
        handleButtonClick()
      }
    })

### What is event-driven programming?

#### Answer

Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building applications that send and receive events. When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.

A common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as `click` and `mouseenter`, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.

    document.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
      // This callback function is run when the user
      // clicks on the document.
    })

Without the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:

    const hub = createEventHub()
    hub.on("message", function(data) {
      console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`)
    })
    hub.emit("message", {
      username: "John",
      text: "Hello?"
    })

With this implementation, `on` is the way to _subscribe_ to an event, while `emit` is the way to _publish_ the event.

- Responds to events that occur by running any callback functions subscribed to the event.

### What is the difference between an expression and a statement in JavaScript?

#### Answer

There are two main syntactic categories in JavaScript: expressions and statements. A third one is both together, referred to as an expression statement. They are roughly summarized as:

- **Expression**: produces a value
- **Statement**: performs an action
- **Expression statement**: produces a value and performs an action

A general rule of thumb:

> _If you can print it or assign it to a variable, it‚Äôs an expression. If you can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a statement._

Statements

    let x = 0

    function declaration() {}

    if (true) {
    }

Statements appear as instructions that do something but don‚Äôt produce values.

    // Assign `x` to the absolute value of `y`.
    var x
    if (y >= 0) {
      x = y
    } else {
      x = -y
    }

The only expression in the above code is `y >= 0` which produces a value, either `true` or `false`. A value is not produced by other parts of the code.

Expressions

Expressions produce a value. They can be passed around to functions because the interpreter replaces them with the value they resolve to.

    5 + 5 // => 10

    lastCharacter("input") // => "t"

    true === true // => true

Expression statements

There is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as an expression using the conditional operator:

    // Assign `x` as the absolute value of `y`.
    var x = y >= 0 ? y : -y

This is both an expression and a statement, because we are declaring a variable `x` (statement) as an evaluation (expression).

### What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?

#### Answer

A value is either truthy or falsy depending on how it is evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy means false-like and truthy means true-like. Essentially, they are values that are coerced to `true` or `false` when performing certain operations.

There are 6 falsy values in JavaScript. They are:

- `false`
- `undefined`
- `null`
- `""` (empty string)
- `NaN`
- `0` (both `+0` and `-0`)

Every other value is considered truthy.

A value‚Äôs truthiness can be examined by passing it into the `Boolean` function.

    Boolean("") // false
    Boolean([]) // true

There is a shortcut for this using the logical NOT¬†`!` operator. Using¬†`!` once will convert a value to its inverse boolean equivalent (i.e. not false is true), and¬†`!` once more will convert back, thus effectively converting the value to a boolean.

    !!"" // false
    !![] // true

### Generate an array, containing the Fibonacci sequence, up until the nth¬†term.

#### Answer

Initialize an empty array of length `n`. Use `Array.prototype.reduce()` to add values into the array, using the sum of the last two values, except for the first two.

    const fibonacci = n =>
      [...Array(n)].reduce(
        (acc, val, i) => acc.concat(i > 1 ? acc[i - 1] + acc[i - 2] : i),
        []

### Given an array of words, write a method to output matching sets of anagrams.

    const words = ['rates', 'rat', 'stare', 'taser', 'tears', 'art', 'tabs', 'tar', 'bats', 'state'];

#### Answer

    const words = ['rates', 'rat', 'stare', 'taser', 'tears', 'art', 'tabs', 'tar', 'bats', 'state'];

    function anagramGroups(wordAry){
        const groupedWords = {};

        // iterate over each word in the array
        wordAry.map(word => {
          // alphabetize the word and a separate variable
          alphaWord = word.split('').sort().join('');
          // if the alphabetize word is already a key, push the actual word value (this is an anagram)
          if(groupedWords[alphaWord]) {
            return groupedWords[alphaWord].push(word);
          }
          // otherwise add the alphabetize word key and actual word value (may not turn out to be an anagram)
          groupedWords[alphaWord] = [word];
        })

        return groupedWords;
    }

    // call the function and store results in a variable called collectedAnagrams
    const collectedAnagrams = anagramGroups(words);

    // iterate over groupedAnagrams, printing out group of values
    for(const sortedWord in collectedAnagrams) {
      if(collectedAnagrams[sortedWord].length > 1) {
        console.log(collectedAnagrams[sortedWord].toString());
      }
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Iterate the array
- Alphabetize each word
- Store alphabetize word as the key value in a groupedWords object with the original word as the value
- Compare alphabetize words to object keys and add additional original words when matches are found
- Iterate over the return object and output the values, when there is more then one. (single values mean no anagram )

### Using flexbox, create a 3-column layout where each column takes up a `col-{n} / 12` ratio of the container.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2"></div>
      <div class="col-7"></div>
      <div class="col-3"></div>
    </div>

#### Answer

Set the¬†`.row` parent to `display: flex;` and use the `flex` shorthand property to give the column classes a `flex-grow` value that corresponds to its ratio value.

    .row {
      display: flex;
    }

    .col-2 {
      flex: 2;
    }

    .col-7 {
      flex: 7;

### What does `0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3` evaluate¬†to?

#### Answer

It evaluates to `false` because JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 standard for Math and it makes use of 64-bit floating numbers. This causes precision errors when doing decimal calculations, in short, due to computers working in Base 2 while decimal is Base 10.

    0.1 + 0.2 // 0.30000000000000004

A solution to this problem would be to use a function that determines if two numbers are approximately equal by defining an error margin (epsilon) value that the difference between two values should be less than.

    const approxEqual = (n1, n2, epsilon = 0.0001) => Math.abs(n1 - n2) < epsilon
    approxEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3) // true

### What is a focus ring? What is the correct solution to handle¬†them?

#### Answer

A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.

In the past, many people specified `outline: 0;` on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.

In recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing `box-shadow` outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.

The best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector¬†`:focus-visible` which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.

### What is the difference between the array methods `map()` and `forEach()`?

#### Answer

Both methods iterate through the elements of an array. `map()` maps each element to a new element by invoking the callback function on each element and returning a new array. On the other hand, `forEach()` invokes the callback function for each element but does not return a new array. `forEach()` is generally used when causing a side effect on each iteration, whereas `map()` is a common functional programming technique.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Use `forEach()` if you need to iterate over an array and cause mutations to the elements without needing to return values to generate a new array.
- `map()` is the right choice to keep data immutable where each value of the original array is mapped to a new array.

### What are fragments?

#### Answer

Fragments allow a React component to return multiple elements without a wrapper, by grouping the children without adding extra elements to the DOM. Fragments offer better performance, lower memory usage, a cleaner DOM and can help in dealing with certain CSS mechanisms (e.g. tables, Flexbox and Grid).

    render() {
      return (
        <React.Fragment>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </React.Fragment>
      );
    }

    // Short syntax supported by Babel 7
    render() {
      return (
        <>
          <ChildA />
          <ChildB />
          <ChildC />
        </>
      );
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Fragments group multiple elements returned from a component, without adding a DOM element around them.

### What is functional programming?

#### Answer

Functional programming is a paradigm in which programs are built in a declarative manner using pure functions that avoid shared state and mutable data. Functions that always return the same value for the same input and don‚Äôt produce side effects are the pillar of functional programming. Many programmers consider this to be the best approach to software development as it reduces bugs and cognitive load.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Cleaner, more concise development experience
- Simple function composition
- Features of JavaScript that enable functional programming (`.map`,¬†`.reduce` etc.)
- JavaScript is multi-paradigm programming language (Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming live in harmony)

### Describe your thoughts on how a single page web app should handle focus when changing¬†routes

#### Answer

Single page applications make use of client-side rendering. This means that ‚Äò[examplesite.com](http://examplesite.com/)‚Äô and ‚Äò[examplesite.com/page2](http://examplesite.com/page2)‚Äô are actually the same HTML web page, but the client app decides what content to drop into that single page at runtime. Your user never actually ‚Äúleaves‚Äù the page, and this causes some accessibility issues in terms of focus.

Unless focus is explicitly managed in the app, a scenario like this may happen:

1.  User visits ‚Äò[examplesite.com](http://examplesite.com/)‚Äô
2.  User clicks a link to go to another route: ‚Äò[examplesite.com/product1](http://examplesite.com/product1)‚Äô
3.  Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)
4.  Focus is still on the link that was clicked in step 2
5.  If a user uses the keyboard or screen reader to now try and read the content, the focused starting point is in the middle of the page on an element no longer visible

Many strategies have been proposed in handling this situation, all involving explicitly managing the focus when the new page content is rendered. [Recent research by GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/) suggests the best approach is:

1.  User visits ‚Äò[examplesite.com](http://examplesite.com/)‚Äô
2.  User clicks a link to go to another route: ‚Äò[examplesite.com/product1](http://examplesite.com/product1)‚Äô
3.  Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)
4.  Client app manually places focus on the main header at the top of the page (almost always this will be the H1 element)

By doing so, focus is reset to the top of the page, ready for the user to begin exploring the new content. This solution requires inserting the main heading into the start of tabbing order with `tabindex="-1"`.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Focus issues caused by client-side rendering, instead of server-side
- Focus should not be left on elements no longer visible on the page
- Challenges faced by screen reader users and users utilising keyboard navigation
- Careful manual focus management required

### What are higher-order components?

#### Answer

A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. It is a pattern that is derived from React‚Äôs compositional nature. Higher-order components are like **pure components** because they accept any dynamically provided child component, but they won‚Äôt modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- They can be used for state abstraction and manipulation, props manipulation, render high jacking, etc.

### What will the console log in this¬†example?

    var foo = 1
    var foobar = function() {
      console.log(foo)
      var foo = 2
    }
    foobar()

#### Answer

Due to hoisting, the local variable `foo` is declared before the `console.log` method is called. This means the local variable `foo` is passed as an argument to `console.log()` instead of the global one declared outside of the function. However, since the value is not hoisted with the variable declaration, the output will be `undefined`, not `2`.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Hoisting is JavaScript‚Äôs default behavior of moving declarations to the top
- Mention of `strict` mode

Additional links

- [MDN docs for hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

### How does hoisting work in JavaScript?

#### Answer

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase. This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.

However, the value is not hoisted with the declaration.

The following snippet:

    console.log(hoist)
    var hoist = "value"

is equivalent to:

    var hoist
    console.log(hoist)
    hoist = "value"

Therefore logging `hoist` outputs `undefined` to the console, not `"value"`.

Hoisting also allows you to invoke a function declaration before it appears to be declared in a program.

    myFunction() // No error; logs "hello"
    function myFunction() {
      console.log("hello")
    }

But be wary of function expressions that are assigned to a variable:

    myFunction() // Error: `myFunction` is not a function
    var myFunction = function() {
      console.log("hello")
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Hoisting is JavaScript‚Äôs default behavior of moving declarations to the top
- Functions declarations are hoisted before variable declarations

### Can a web page contain multiple `<header>` elements? What about `<footer>` elements?

#### Answer

Yes to both. The W3 documents state that the tags represent the header(`<header>`) and footer(`<footer>`) areas of their nearest ancestor ‚Äúsection‚Äù. So not only can the page `<body>` contain a header and a footer, but so can every `<article>` and `<section>` element.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- W3 recommends having as many as you want, but only 1 of each for each ‚Äúsection‚Äù of your page, i.e. body, section etc.

Additional links

### Discuss the differences between an HTML specification and a browser‚Äôs implementation thereof.

#### Answer

HTML specifications such as `HTML5` define a set of rules that a document must adhere to in order to be ‚Äúvalid‚Äù according to that specification. In addition, a specification provides instructions on how a browser must interpret and render such a document.

A browser is said to ‚Äúsupport‚Äù a specification if it handles valid documents according to the rules of the specification. As of yet, no browser supports all aspects of the `HTML5` specification (although all of the major browser support most of it), and as a result, it is necessary for the developer to confirm whether the aspect they are making use of will be supported by all of the browsers on which they hope to display their content. This is why cross-browser support continues to be a headache for developers, despite the improved specificiations.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- `HTML5` defines some rules to follow for an invalid `HTML5` document (i.e., one that contains syntactical errors)
- However, invalid documents may contain anything, so it‚Äôs impossible for the specification to handle all possibilities comprehensively.
- Thus, many decisions about how to handle malformed documents are left up to the browser.

### What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?

#### Answer

In HTML, the attribute name is in all lowercase and is given a string invoking a function defined somewhere:

    <button onclick="handleClick()"></button>

In React, the attribute name is camelCase and are passed the function reference inside curly braces:

    <button onClick={handleClick} />

In HTML, `false` can be returned to prevent default behavior, whereas in React `preventDefault` has to be called explicitly.

    <a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false" />

    function handleClick(e) {
      e.preventDefault()
      console.log("The link was clicked.")
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- HTML uses lowercase, React uses camelCase.

### What are some differences that XHTML has compared to¬†HTML?

#### Answer

Some of the key differences are:

- An XHTML element must have an XHTML `<DOCTYPE>`
- Attributes values must be enclosed in quotes
- Attribute minimization is forbidden (e.g. one has to use `checked="checked"` instead of `checked`)
- Elements must always be properly nested
- Elements must always be closed
- Special characters must be escaped

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Any element can be self-closed
- Tags ands attributes are case-sensitive, usually lowercase

### Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: `<header>`, `<article>`,`<section>`, `<footer>`

#### Answer

- `<header>` is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author‚Äôs name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.
- `<article>` is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing its meaning. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.
- `<section>` is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.
- `<footer>` is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author‚Äôs name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Other semantic elements are `<form>` and `<table>`

### What is HTML5 Web Storage? Explain `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

#### Answer

With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user‚Äôs browser. The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a web page can only access data stored by itself.

**Differences between** `localStorage` **and** `sessionStorage` **regarding lifetime:**

- Data stored through `localStorage` is permanent: it does not expire and remains stored on the user‚Äôs computer until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it.
- `sessionStorage` has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the data got stored. When the tab is permanently closed, any data stored through `sessionStorage` is deleted.

**Differences between** `localStorage` **and** `sessionStorage` **regarding storage scope:** Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.

- `sessionStorage` is also scoped on a per-window basis. Two browser tabs with documents from the same origin have separate `sessionStorage` data.
- Unlike in `localStorage`, the same scripts from the same origin can‚Äôt access each other‚Äôs `sessionStorage` when opened in different tabs.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Earlier, this was done with cookies.
- The storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) than with cookies and its faster.
- The data is never transferred to the server and can only be used if the client specifically asks for it.

### What is the reason for wrapping the entire contents of a JavaScript source file in a function that is immediately invoked?

#### Answer

This technique is very common in JavaScript libraries. It creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries. The function is immediately invoked so that the namespace (library name) is assigned the return value of the function.

    const myLibrary = (function() {
      var privateVariable = 2
      return {
        publicMethod: () => privateVariable
      }
    })()
    privateVariable // ReferenceError
    myLibrary.publicMethod() // 2

- Creates a private namespace

### Explain the differences between imperative and declarative programming.

#### Answer

These two types of programming can roughly be summarized as:

- Imperative: **how** to achieve something
- Declarative: **what** should be achieved

A common example of declarative programming is CSS. The developer specifies CSS properties that describe what something should look like rather than how to achieve it. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is abstracted away by the browser.

On the other hand, imperative programming involves the steps required to achieve something. In JavaScript, the differences can be contrasted like so:

Imperative

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    const numbersDoubled = []
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      numbersDoubled[i] = numbers[i] * 2
    }

We manually loop over the numbers of the array and assign the new index as the number doubled.

Declarative

    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    const numbersDoubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2)

We declare that the new array is mapped to a new one where each value is doubled.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Declarative programming often works with functions and expressions. Imperative programming frequently uses statements and relies on low-level features that cause mutations, while declarative programming has a strong focus on abstraction and purity.
- Declarative programming is more terse and easier to process at a glance.

### What are inline conditional expressions?

#### Answer

Since a JSX element tree is one large expression, you cannot embed statements inside. Conditional expressions act as a replacement for statements to use inside the tree.

For example, this won‚Äôt work:

    function App({ messages, isVisible }) {
      return (
        <div>
          if (messages.length > 0) {
            <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
          } else {
            <h2>You have no unread messages.</h2>
          }
          if (isVisible) {
            <p>I am visible.</p>
          }
        </div>
      )
    }

Logical AND `&&` and the ternary¬†`? :` operator replace the `if`/`else` statements.

    function App({ messages, isVisible }) {
      return (
        <div>
          {messages.length > 0 ? (
            <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
          ) : (
            <h2>You have no unread messages.</h2>
          )}
          {isVisible && <p>I am visible.</p>}
        </div>
      )
    }

### What is a key? What are the benefits of using it in¬†lists?

#### Answer

Keys are a special string attribute that helps React identify which items have been changed, added or removed. They are used when rendering array elements to give them a stable identity. Each element‚Äôs key must be unique (e.g. IDs from the data or indexes as a last resort).

    const todoItems = todos.map(todo => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>)

- Using indexes as keys is not recommended if the order of items may change, as it might negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
- If you extract list items as a separate component then apply keys on the list component instead of the `<li>` tag.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Keys give elements in a collection a stable identity and help React identify changes.
- You should avoid using indexes as keys if the order of items may change.
- You should lift the key up to the component, instead of the `<li>` element, if you extract list items as components.

### What are landmark roles and how can they be¬†useful?

#### Answer

Landmark roles is a way to identify different sections of a page like the main content or a navigation region. The Landmarks helps assistive technology users to navigate a page, allowing them skip over areas of it.

For example,

    <div id="header" role="banner">Header of the Page</div>
    <div id="content" role="main">Main Content Goes Here</div>

### What is the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic¬†scoping?

#### Answer

Lexical scoping refers to when the location of a function‚Äôs definition determines which variables you have access to. On the other hand, dynamic scoping uses the location of the function‚Äôs invocation to determine which variables are available.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Lexical scoping is also known as static scoping.
- Lexical scoping in JavaScript allows for the concept of closures.
- Most languages use lexical scoping because it tends to promote source code that is more easily understood.

### What are the lifecycle methods in¬†React?

#### Answer

`getDerivedStateFromProps`: Executed before rendering on the initial mount and all component updates. Used to update the state based on changes in props over time. Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.

`componentDidMount`: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.

`shouldComponentUpdate`: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn‚Äôt need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.

`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before `componentDidUpdate`. Any value returned from this method will be passed to `componentDidUpdate`.

`componentDidUpdate`: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

`componentWillUnmount`: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

`componentDidCatch`: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the _child_ component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.

### What are the different phases of the component lifecycle in¬†React?

#### Answer

There are four different phases of component‚Äôs lifecycle:

**Initialization**: In this phase, the component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.

**Mounting**: The react component is ready to mount to the DOM. This phase covers the `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `componentDidMount` lifecycle methods.

**Updating**: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers the `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods.

**Unmounting**: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method.

**Error Handling**: In this phase, the component is called whenever there‚Äôs an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor for any child component. This phase includes the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method.

### What does lifting state up in React¬†mean?

#### Answer

When several components need to share the same data, then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. For example, if two child components share the same data, it is recommended to move the shared state to parent instead of maintaining the local state in both child components.

### Create a function that masks a string of characters with `#` except for the last four (4) characters.

    mask("123456789") // "#####6789"

#### Answer

> _There are many ways to solve this problem, this is just one one of them._

Using `String.prototype.slice()` we can grab the last 4 characters of the string by passing `-4` as an argument. Then, using `String.prototype.padStart()`, we can pad the string to the original length with the repeated mask character.

    const mask = (str, maskChar = "#") =>
      str.slice(-4).padStart(str.length, maskChar)

### What is memoization?

#### Answer

Memoization is the process of caching the output of function calls so that subsequent calls are faster. Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.

A basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:

    const memoize = fn => {
      const cache = new Map()
      return value => {
        const cachedResult = cache.get(value)
        if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult
        const result = fn(value)
        cache.set(value, result)
        return result
      }
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- The above technique returns a unary function even if the function can take multiple arguments.
- The first function call will be slower than usual because of the overhead created by checking if a cached result exists and setting a result before returning the value.
- Memoization increases performance on subsequent function calls but still needs to do work on the first call.

### How do you ensure methods have the correct `this` context in React component classes?

#### Answer

In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their `this` context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, `Function.prototype.bind()` can be used to enforce the `this` context as the component instance.

    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }

    handleClick() {
      // Perform some logic
    }

- The `bind` approach can be verbose and requires defining a `constructor`, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:

<!-- -->

    handleClick = () => {
      console.log('this is:', this);
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
          Click me
        </button>
      );
    }

- You can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical `this` (referring to the component instance) is preserved:

<!-- -->

    <button onClick={e => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me</button>

Note that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks `shouldComponentUpdate` / `PureComponent` shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with `bind` in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- You can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.

### What is a MIME type and what is it used¬†for?

#### Answer

`MIME` is an acronym for `Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions`. It is used as a standard way of classifying file types over the Internet.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- A `MIME type` actually has two parts: a type and a subtype that are separated by a slash (/). For example, the `MIME type` for Microsoft Word files is `application/msword` (i.e., type is application and the subtype is msword).

### Contrast mutable and immutable values, and mutating vs non-mutating methods.

#### Answer

The two terms can be contrasted as:

- Mutable: subject to change
- Immutable: cannot change

In JavaScript, objects are mutable while primitive values are immutable. This means operations performed on objects can change the original reference in some way, while operations performed on a primitive value cannot change the original value.

All `String.prototype` methods do not have an effect on the original string and return a new string. On the other hand, while some methods of `Array.prototype` do not mutate the original array reference and produce a fresh array, some cause mutations.

    const myString = "hello!"
    myString.replace("!", "") // returns a new string, cannot mutate the original value

    const originalArray = [1, 2, 3]
    originalArray.push(4) // mutates originalArray, now [1, 2, 3, 4]
    originalArray.concat(4) // returns a new array, does not mutate the original

### What is the only value not equal to itself in JavaScript?

#### Answer

`NaN` (Not-a-Number) is the only value not equal to itself when comparing with any of the comparison operators. `NaN` is often the result of meaningless math computations, so two `NaN` values make no sense to be considered equal.

### NodeJS often uses a callback pattern where if an error is encountered during execution, this error is passed as the first argument to the callback. What are the advantages of this¬†pattern?

    fs.readFile(filePath, function(err, data) {
      if (err) {
        // handle the error, the return is important here
        // so execution stops here
        return console.log(err)
      }
      // use the data object
      console.log(data)
    })

#### Answer

Advantages include:

- Not needing to process data if there is no need to even reference it
- Having a consistent API leads to more adoption
- Ability to easily adapt a callback pattern that will lead to more maintainable code

As you can see from below example, the callback is called with null as its first argument if there is no error. However, if there is an error, you create an Error object, which then becomes the callback‚Äôs only parameter. The callback function allows a user to easily know whether or not an error occurred.

This practice is also called the _Node.js error convention_, and this kind of callback implementations are called _error-first callbacks_.

    var isTrue = function(value, callback) {
      if (value === true) {
        callback(null, "Value was true.")
      } else {
        callback(new Error("Value is not true!"))
      }
    }

    var callback = function(error, retval) {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error)
        return
      }
      console.log(retval)
    }

    isTrue(false, callback)
    isTrue(true, callback)

    /*
      { stack: [Getter/Setter],
        arguments: undefined,
        type: undefined,
        message: 'Value is not true!' }
      Value was true.
    */

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- This is just a convention. However, you should stick to it.

### What is the event loop in¬†Node.js?

#### Answer

The event loop handles all async callbacks. Callbacks are queued in a loop, while other code runs, and will run one by one when the response for each one has been received.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded

### What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

#### Answer

In JavaScript, two values discretely represent nothing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`undefined` and `null`. The concrete difference between them is that `null` is explicit, while `undefined` is implicit. When a property does not exist or a variable has not been given a value, the value is `undefined`. `null` is set as the value to explicitly indicate ‚Äúno value‚Äù. In essence, `undefined` is used when the nothing is not known, and `null` is used when the nothing is known.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- `typeof undefined` evaluates to `"undefined"`.
- `typeof null` evaluates `"object"`. However, it is still a primitive value and this is considered an implementation bug in JavaScript.
- `undefined == null` evaluates to `true`.

Additional links

### Describe the different ways to create an object. When should certain ways be preferred over¬†others?

#### Answer

Object literal

Often used to store one occurrence of data.

    const person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 50,
      birthday() {
        this.age++
      }
    }
    person.birthday() // person.age === 51

Constructor

Often used when you need to create multiple instances of an object, each with their own data that other instances of the class cannot affect. The `new` operator must be used before invoking the constructor or the global object will be mutated.

    function Person(name, age) {
      this.name = name
      this.age = age
    }
    Person.prototype.birthday = function() {
      this.age++
    }
    const person1 = new Person("John", 50)
    const person2 = new Person("Sally", 20)
    person1.birthday() // person1.age === 51
    person2.birthday() // person2.age === 21

Factory function

Creates a new object similar to a constructor, but can store private data using a closure. There is also no need to use `new` before invoking the function or the `this` keyword. Factory functions usually discard the idea of prototypes and keep all properties and methods as own properties of the object.

    const createPerson = (name, age) => {
      const birthday = () => person.age++
      const person = { name, age, birthday }
      return person
    }
    const person = createPerson("John", 50)
    person.birthday() // person.age === 51

`Object.create()`

Sets the prototype of the newly created object.

    const personProto = {
      birthday() {
        this.age++
      }
    }
    const person = Object.create(personProto)
    person.age = 50
    person.birthday() // person.age === 51

A second argument can also be supplied to `Object.create()` which acts as a descriptor for the new properties to be defined.

    Object.create(personProto, {
      age: {
        value: 50,
        writable: true,
        enumerable: true
      }
    })

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Prototypes are objects that other objects inherit properties and methods from.
- Factory functions offer private properties and methods through a closure but increase memory usage as a tradeoff, while classes do not have private properties or methods but reduce memory impact by reusing a single prototype object.

### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

#### Answer

Parameters are the variable names of the function definition, while arguments are the values given to a function when it is invoked.

    function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {
      console.log(arguments[0]) // "argument1"
    }
    myFunction("argument1", "argument2")

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- `arguments` is an array-like object containing information about the arguments supplied to an invoked function.
- `myFunction.length` describes the arity of a function (how many parameters it has, regardless of how many arguments it is supplied).

### Does JavaScript pass by value or by reference?

### Create a function `pipe` that performs left-to-right function composition by returning a function that accepts one argument.

    const square = v => v * v
    const double = v => v * 2
    const addOne = v => v + 1
    const res = pipe(square, double, addOne)
    res(3) // 19; addOne(double(square(3)))

#### Answer

Gather all supplied arguments using the rest operator¬†`...` and return a unary function that uses `Array.prototype.reduce()` to run the value through the series of functions before returning the final value.

    const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((v, fn) => fn(v), x)

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.

### What are portals in¬†React?

#### Answer

Portal are the recommended way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

Both increment the variable value by 1. The difference is what they evaluate to.

The postfix increment operator evaluates to the value _before_ it was incremented.

    let i = 0
    i++ // 0
    // i === 1

The prefix increment operator evaluates to the value _after_ it was incremented.

    let i = 0
    ++i // 1
    // i === 1

### In which states can a Promise¬†be?

#### Answer

A `Promise` is in one of these states:

- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise‚Äôs then method are called.

### What are Promises?

#### Answer

The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. An example can be the following snippet, which after 100ms prints out the result string to the standard output. Also, note the catch, which can be used for error handling. `Promise`s are chainable.

    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("result")
      }, 100)
    })
      .then(console.log)

### How to apply prop validation in¬†React?

#### Answer

When the application is running in development mode, React will automatically check for all props that we set on components to make sure they are the correct data type. For incorrect data types, it will generate warning messages in the console for development mode. They are stripped in production mode due to their performance impact. Required props are defined with `isRequired`.

For example, we define `propTypes` for component as below:

    import PropTypes from "prop-types"

    class User extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
        age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>
          <h2>Age, {this.props.age}
        )
      }
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- We can define custom `propTypes`
- Using `propTypes` is not mandatory. However, it is a good practice and can reduce bugs.

### How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?

#### Answer

In the classical inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit their properties and functions from a class, which acts as a blueprint for the object. Object instances are typically created using a constructor and the `new` keyword.

In the prototypal inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit directly from other objects and are typically created using factory functions or `Object.create()`.

### What is a pure function?

#### Answer

A pure function is a function that satisfies these two conditions:

- Given the same input, the function returns the same output.
- The function doesn‚Äôt cause side effects outside of the function‚Äôs scope (i.e. mutate data outside the function or data supplied to the function).

Pure functions can mutate local data within the function as long as it satisfies the two conditions above.

Pure

    const a = (x, y) => x + y
    const b = (arr, value) => arr.concat(value)
    const c = arr => [...arr].sort((a, b) => a - b)

Impure

    const a = (x, y) => x + y + Math.random()
    const b = (arr, value) => (arr.push(value), arr)
    const c = arr => arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Pure functions are easier to reason about due to their reliability.
- All functions should be pure unless explicitly causing a side effect (i.e. `setInnerHTML`).
- If a function does not return a value, it is an indication that it is causing side effects.

### How do you write comments inside a JSX tree in¬†React?

#### Answer

Comments must be wrapped inside curly braces `{}` and use the `/* */` syntax.

    const tree = (
      <div>
        {/* Comment */}
        <p>Text</p>
      </div>
    )

### What is recursion and when is it¬†useful?

#### Answer

Recursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.

For example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply‚Ä¶ we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.

    const nest = (items, id = null, link = "parent_id") =>
      items
        .filter(item => item[link] === id)
        .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }))

    const comments = [
      { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: "First reply to post." },
      { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: "First reply to comment #1." },
      { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: "Second reply to comment #1." },
      { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: "First reply to comment #3." },
      { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: "First reply to comment #4." },
      { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: "Second reply to post." }
    ]

    nest(comments)
    /*
    [
      { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: "First reply to post.", children: [...] },
      { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: "Second reply to post.", children: [] }
    ]
    */

In the above example, the base condition is met if `filter()` returns an empty array. The chained `map()` won‚Äôt invoke the callback function which contains the recursive call, thereby breaking the loop.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Recursion is useful when working with data structures containing an unknown number of nested structures.
- Recursion must have a base condition to be met that breaks out of the loop or it will call itself indefinitely.

### What is the output of the following code?

    const a = [1, 2, 3]
    const b = [1, 2, 3]
    const c = "1,2,3"

    console.log(a == c)
    console.log(a == b)

#### Answer

The first `console.log` outputs `true` because JavaScript‚Äôs compiler performs type conversion and therefore it compares to strings by their value. On the other hand, the second `console.log` outputs `false` because Arrays are Objects and Objects are compared by reference.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- JavaScript performs automatic type conversion
- Objects are compared by reference
- Primitives are compared by value

### What are refs in React? When should they be¬†used?

#### Answer

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. Refs should be used sparringly, but there are some good use cases for refs, such as:

- Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
- Triggering imperative animations.
- Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

Refs are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, assign the `ref` to the instance property within the constructor:

    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.myRef = React.createRef()
      }

      render() {
        return <div ref={this.myRef} />
      }
    }

Refs can also be used in functional components with the help of closures.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Refs are used to return a reference to an element.
- Refs shouldn‚Äôt be overused.
- You can create a ref using `React.createRef()` and attach to elements via the `ref` attribute.

### Where and why is the `rel="noopener"` attribute used?

#### Answer

The `rel="noopener"` is an attribute used in `<a>` elements (hyperlinks). It prevents pages from having a `window.opener` property, which would otherwise point to the page from where the link was opened and would allow the page opened from the hyperlink to manipulate the page where the hyperlink is.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- `rel="noopener"` is applied to hyperlinks.
- `rel="noopener"` prevents opened links from manipulating the source page.

### What is¬†REST?

#### Answer

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software design pattern for network architecture. A RESTful web application exposes data in the form of information about its resources.

Generally, this concept is used in web applications to manage state. With most applications, there is a common theme of reading, creating, updating, and destroying data. Data is modularized into separate tables like `posts`, `users`, `comments`, and a RESTful API exposes access to this data with:

- An identifier for the resource. This is known as the endpoint or URL for the resource.
- The operation the server should perform on that resource in the form of an HTTP method or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Here is an example of the URL and HTTP method with a `posts` resource:

- Reading: `/posts/` =&gt; GET
- Creating: `/posts/new` =&gt; POST
- Updating: `/posts/:id` =&gt; PUT
- Destroying: `/posts/:id` =&gt; DELETE

### What does the following function¬†return?

    function greet() {
      return
      {
        message: "hello"
      }
    }

#### Answer

Because of JavaScript‚Äôs automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the compiler places a semicolon after `return` keyword and therefore it returns `undefined` without an error being thrown.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Automatic semicolon placement can lead to time-consuming bugs

### Are semicolons required in JavaScript?

#### Answer

Sometimes. Due to JavaScript‚Äôs automatic semicolon insertion, the interpreter places semicolons after most statements. This means semicolons can be omitted in most cases.

However, there are some cases where they are required. They are not required at the beginning of a block, but are if they follow a line and:

1.  The line starts with `[`

<!-- -->

    const previousLine = 3
    ;[1, 2, previousLine].map(n => n * 2)

1.  The line starts with `(`

<!-- -->

    const previousLine = 3
    ;(function() {
      // ...
    })()

In the above cases, the interpreter does not insert a semicolon after `3`, and therefore it will see the `3` as attempting object property access or being invoked as a function, which will throw errors.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Semicolons are usually optional in JavaScript but have edge cases where they are required.
- If you don‚Äôt use semicolons, tools like Prettier will insert semicolons for you in the places where they are required on save in a text editor to prevent errors.

### What is short-circuit evaluation in JavaScript?

#### Answer

Short-circuit evaluation involves logical operations evaluating from left-to-right and stopping early.

    true || false

In the above sample using logical OR, JavaScript won‚Äôt look at the second operand `false`, because the expression evaluates to `true` regardless. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.

This also works for logical AND.

    false && true

This means you can have an expression that throws an error if evaluated, and it won‚Äôt cause issues.

    true || nonexistentFunction()
    false && nonexistentFunction()

This remains true for multiple operations because of left-to-right evaluation.

    true || nonexistentFunction() || window.nothing.wouldThrowError
    true || window.nothing.wouldThrowError
    true

A common use case for this behavior is setting default values. If the first operand is falsy the second operand will be evaluated.

    const options = {}
    const setting = options.setting || "default"
    setting // "default"

Another common use case is only evaluating an expression if the first operand is truthy.

    // Instead of:
    addEventListener("click", e => {
      if (e.target.closest("button")) {
        handleButtonClick(e)
      }
    })

    // You can take advantage of short-circuit evaluation:
    addEventListener(
      "click",
      e => e.target.closest("button") && handleButtonClick(e)
    )

In the above case, if `e.target` is not or does not contain an element matching the `"button"` selector, the function will not be called. This is because the first operand will be falsy, causing the second operand to not be evaluated.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Logical operations do not produce a boolean unless the operand(s) evaluate to a boolean.

### What are the advantages of using CSS sprites and how are they utilized?

#### Answer

CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.

Under HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.

However, according to [benchmark results](https://blog.octo.com/en/http2-arrives-but-sprite-sets-aint-no-dead/), although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.

To utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` to ultimately alter the `background` of an element.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` can be used to utilize a spritesheet.

### What is a stateful component in¬†React?

#### Answer

A stateful component is a component whose behavior depends on its state. This means that two separate instances of the component if given the same props will not necessarily render the same output, unlike pure function components.

    // Stateful class component
    class App extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = { count: 0 }
      }
      render() {
        // ...
      }
    }

    // Stateful function component
    function App() {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
      return // ...
    }

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Stateful components have internal state that they depend on.
- Stateful components are class components or function components that use stateful Hooks.
- Stateful components have their state initialized in the constructor or with `useState()`.

- [React docs on State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

### What is a stateless component?

#### Answer

A stateless component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state. Stateless components can be either functional or class components. Stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test since they are guaranteed to produce the same output given the same props. Stateless functional components should be preferred when lifecycle hooks don‚Äôt need to be used.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Stateless components are independent of their state.
- Stateless components can be either class or functional components.
- Stateless functional components avoid the `this` keyword altogether.

### Explain the difference between a static method and an instance¬†method.

#### Answer

Static methods belong to a class and don‚Äôt act on instances, while instance methods belong to the class prototype which is inherited by all instances of the class and acts on them.

    Array.isArray // static method of Array
    Array.prototype.push // instance method of Array

In this case, the `Array.isArray` method does not make sense as an instance method of arrays because we already know the value is an array when working with it.

Instance methods could technically work as static methods, but provide terser syntax:

    const arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr.push(4)
    Array.push(arr, 4)

### What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

#### Answer

Synchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete.

Asynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed.

In JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it. However, asynchronous operations not part of the program (such as `XMLHttpRequest` or `setTimeout`) are processed outside of the main thread because they are controlled by native code (browser APIs), but callbacks part of the program will still be executed synchronously.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an ‚Äúevent loop‚Äù.
- Functions like `alert` block the main thread so that no user input is registered until the user closes it.

### What is the `this` keyword and how does it¬†work?

#### Answer

The `this` keyword is an object that represents the context of an executing function. Regular functions can have their `this` value changed with the methods `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()`. Arrow functions implicitly bind `this` so that it refers to the context of its lexical environment, regardless of whether or not its context is set explicitly with `call()`.

Here are some common examples of how `this` works:

Object literals

`this` refers to the object itself inside regular functions if the object precedes the invocation of the function.

Properties set as `this` do not refer to the object.

    var myObject = {
      property: this,
      regularFunction: function() {
        return this
      },
      arrowFunction: () => {
        return this
      },
      iife: (function() {
        return this
      })()
    }
    myObject.regularFunction() // myObject
    myObject["regularFunction"]() // my Object

    myObject.property // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
    myObject.arrowFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
    myObject.iife // NOT myObject; lexical `this`
    const regularFunction = myObject.regularFunction
    regularFunction() // NOT myObject; lexical `this`

Event listeners

`this` refers to the element listening to the event.

    document.body.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log(this) // document.body
    })

Constructors

`this` refers to the newly created object.

    class Example {
      constructor() {
        console.log(this) // myExample
      }
    }
    const myExample = new Example()

Manual

With `call()` and `apply()`, `this` refers to the object passed as the first argument.

    var myFunction = function() {
      return this
    }
    myFunction.call({ customThis: true }) // { customThis: true }

Unwanted `this`

Because `this` can change depending on the scope, it can have unexpected values when using regular functions.

    var obj = {
      arr: [1, 2, 3],
      doubleArr() {
        return this.arr.map(function(value) {
          // this is now this.arr
          return this.double(value)
        })
      },
      double() {
        return value * 2
      }
    }
    obj.doubleArr() // Uncaught TypeError: this.double is not a function

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- In non-strict mode, global `this` is the global object (`window` in browsers), while in strict mode global `this` is `undefined`.
- `Function.prototype.call` and `Function.prototype.apply` set the `this` context of an executing function as the first argument, with `call` accepting a variadic number of arguments thereafter, and `apply` accepting an array as the second argument which are fed to the function in a variadic manner.
- `Function.prototype.bind` returns a new function that enforces the `this` context as the first argument which cannot be changed by other functions.
- If a function requires its `this` context to be changed based on how it is called, you must use the `function` keyword. Use arrow functions when you want `this` to be the surrounding (lexical) context.

### What does the following code evaluate¬†to?

### What are JavaScript data¬†types?

#### Answer

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types, six of them being primitive: `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Number`, `String`, `Symbol` and one non-primitive data type: `Object`.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Mention of newly added `Symbol` data type
- `Array`, `Date` and `function` are all of type `object`
- Functions in JavaScript are objects with the capability of being callable

### What is the purpose of JavaScript UI libraries/frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Hyperapp, etc?

#### Answer

The main purpose is to avoid manipulating the DOM directly and keep the state of an application in sync with the UI easily. Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.

When working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or `data` attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- The virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM tree in the form of plain objects, which allows a library to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt on each change, while the real DOM only updates what needs to be changed. Comparing the new virtual DOM against the previous one leads to high efficiency as changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM.
- JSX is an extension to JavaScript that provides XML-like syntax to create virtual DOM objects which is transformed to function calls by a transpiler. It simplifies control flow (if statements/ternary expressions) compared to tagged template literals.

### What does `'use strict'` do and what are some of the key benefits to using¬†it?

#### Answer

Including `'use strict'` at the beginning of your JavaScript source file enables strict mode, which enforces more strict parsing and error handling of JavaScript code. It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:

- Easier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.
- Disallows variable redefinition.
- Prevents accidental global variables.
- Oftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.
- Simplifies `eval()` and `arguments`.
- Helps make JavaScript more secure.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- Eliminates `this` coercion, throwing an error when `this` references a value of `null` or `undefined`.
- Throws an error on invalid usage of `delete`.
- Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript

### What are the differences between `var`, `let`, `const` and no keyword statements?

#### Answer

No keyword

When no keyword exists before a variable assignment, it is either assigning a global variable if one does not exist, or reassigns an already declared variable. In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.

var

`var` was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.

Below, by the time the the `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already finished and the `i` variable is `10`, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.

### Resources:

Resources:  
<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/e3f9e82a133b0a8dca00f61d9ddcd62b>

### Here‚Äôs the code from this¬†article:

    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // logs `10` ten times
        console.log(i)
      })
    }

    /* Solutions with `var` */
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in
      // that point in time
      setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      // Create a new function scope that will use the value
      // as-is in that point in time
      ;(i => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log(i)
        })
      })(i)
    }

let

`let` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.

    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
        console.log(i)
      })
    }

const

`const` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won‚Äôt be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change). It is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

    const myObject = {}
    myObject.prop = "hello!" // No error
    myObject = "hello" // Error

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- All declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.
- However, with `let` and `const` there is a concept called the temporal dead zone (TDZ). While the declarations are still hoisted, there is a period between entering scope and being declared where they cannot be accessed.
- Show a common issue with using `var` and how `let` can solve it, as well as a solution that keeps `var`.
- `var` should be avoided whenever possible and prefer `const` as the default declaration statement for all variables unless they will be reassigned later, then use `let` if so.

### What is a virtual DOM and why is it used in libraries/frameworks?

#### Answer

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a representation of the real DOM in the form of plain JavaScript objects. These objects have properties to describe the real DOM nodes they represent: the node name, its attributes, and child nodes.

    <div class="counter">
      <h1>0</h1>
      <button>-</button>
      <button>+</button>
    </div>

The above markup‚Äôs virtual DOM representation might look like this:

    {
      nodeName: "div",
      attributes: { class: "counter" },
      children: [
        {
          nodeName: "h1",
          attributes: {},
          children: [0]
        },
        {
          nodeName: "button",
          attributes: {},
          children: ["-"]
        },
        {
          nodeName: "button",
          attributes: {},
          children: ["+"]
        }
      ]
    }

The library/framework uses the virtual DOM as a means to improve performance. When the state of an application changes, the real DOM needs to be updated to reflect it. However, changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM. The previous virtual DOM can be compared to the new virtual DOM very quickly in comparison.

Once the changes between the old VDOM and new VDOM have been calculated by the diffing engine of the framework, the real DOM can be patched efficiently in the least time possible to match the new state of the application.

### What is WCAG? What are the differences between A, AA, and AAA compliance?

#### Answer

WCAG stands for ‚ÄúWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines‚Äù. It is a standard describing how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities They have 12-13 guidelines and for each one, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The higher the level, the higher the impact on the design of the web content. The higher the level, the web content is essentially more accessible by more users. Depending on where you live/work, there may be regulations requiring websites to meet certain levels of compliance. For instance, in Ontario, Canada, beginning January 1, 2021 all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet AA compliance.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- A guideline for making web content more accessible
- 3 different levels (A, AA, and AAA) of compliance for each guideline

### What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent¬†it?

#### Answer

XSS refers to client-side code injection where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.

For example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a `<script>` tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.

- The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user‚Äôs session cookie, they can impersonate the user.
- The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.
- The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.

#### Don‚Äôt forget:

- On the client, using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.
- On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won‚Äôt execute the script.

### [Components of HTTP-based systems](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#components_of_http-based_systems "Permalink to Components of HTTP-based systems")

HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.

Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer, called the _response_. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server), which perform different operations and act as gateways or [caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache), for example.

1.  `Proxies`¬†: Modify your request so it appears to come from a different source.
2.  `Gateways`¬†: Pretend to be the resource server you requested.
3.  `Tunnels`¬†: Simply passes your request along.

### HTTP Requests

**Structure of an HTTP Request**

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: appacademy.io
    Connection: keep-alive
    Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.132 Safari/537.36
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

### Example of a¬†request:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*tq-BRYuzZ_Dx8s1g5xJKKQ.png)

- **Request-line & HTTP verbs**
- The first line of an HTTP Request made up of three parts:

1.  The `Method`¬†: Indicated by an HTTP Verb.
2.  The `URI`¬†: Uniform Resource Indicator that ID‚Äôs our request.
3.  THe `HTTP` **Version**¬†: Version we expect to use.

- HTTP Verbs are a simply way of declaring our intention to the server.
- `GET`¬†: Used for direct requests.
- `POST`: Used for creating new resources on the server.
- `PUT`: Used to updated a resource on the server.
- `PATCH`¬†: Similar to PUT, but do not require the whole resource to perform the update.
- `DELETE`¬†: Used to destroy resources on the server.

**Headers**

- Key-Value pairs that come after the request line‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey appear on sep. lines and define metadata needed to process the request.
- Some common headers:
- `Host`¬†: Root path for our URI.
- `User-Agent`¬†: Displays information about which browser the request originated from.
- `Referer`¬†: Defines the URL you‚Äôre coming from.
- `Accept`¬†: Indicates what the client will receive.
- `Content`**‚Äì**¬†: Define Details about the body of the request.

**Body**

- For when we need to send data that doesn‚Äôt fit into the header & is too complex for the URI we can use the _body_.
- `URL encoding`¬†: Most common way form data is formatted.
- `name=claire&age=29&iceCream=vanilla`
- We can also format using JSON or XML.

**Sending an HTTP request from the command line**

- **netcat**¬†: (nc) A Utility that comes as part of Unix-line environments such as Ubuntu and macOS.
- Allows us to open a direct connection with a URL and manually send HTTP requests.
- `nc -v appacademy.io 80`
- `man nc` to open the netcat manual.

### HTTP Responses

**Structure of a Response**

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Connection: close
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
    Set-Cookie: _rails-class-site_session=BAh7CEkiD3Nlc3Npb25faWQGOgZFVEkiJTM5NWM5YTVlNTEyZDFmNTNlN; path=/; secure; HttpOnly
    X-Request-Id: cf5f30dd-99d0-46d7-86d7-6fe57753b20d
    X-Runtime: 0.006894
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
    Vary: Origin
    Via: 1.1 vegur
    Expect-CT: max-age=604800, report-uri="https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct"
    Server: cloudflare
    CF-RAY: 51d641d1ca7d2d45-TXL

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    ...
    ...
    </html>

**Status**

- First line of an HTTP response‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägives us a high level overview of the server‚Äôs intentions. (`status line`)
- `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
- `HTTP status codes`¬†: numeric way of representing a server‚Äôs response.
- Follow the structure: x: xxx‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääxxx;

### `Status codes 100 - 199: Informational`

- Allow the clinet to know that a req. was received, and provides extra info from the server.

### `Status codes 200 - 299: Successful`

- Indicate that the request has succeeded and the server is handling it.
- Common Examples: 200 OK (req received and fulfilled) & 201 Created (received and new record was created)

### `Status codes 300 - 399: Redirection`

- Let the client know if there has been a change.
- Common Examples: 301 Moved Permanently (resource you requested is in a totally new location) & 302 Found (indicates a temporary move)

### `Status codes 400 - 499: Client Error`

- Indicate problem with client‚Äôs request.
- Common Examples: 400 Bad Request (received, but could not understand) & 401 Unauthorized (resource exists but you‚Äôre not allowed to see w/o authentication) & 403 Forbidden (resource exists but you‚Äôre not allowed to see it at all ) & 404 Not Found (resource requested does not exist);

### `Status codes 500 - 599: Server Error`

- Indicates request was formatted correctly, but the server couldn‚Äôt do what you asked due to an internal problem.
- Common Examples: 500 Internal Server Error (Server had trouble processing) & 504 Gateway Timeout (Server timeout);

### **Headers**¬†: Work just like HTTP requests.

> Common Examples:

- `Location`¬†: Used by client for redirection responses.
- `Content-Type`¬†: Let‚Äôs client know what format the body is in.
- `Expires`¬†: When response is no longer valid
- `Content-Disposition`¬†: Let‚Äôs client know how to display the response.
- `Set-Cookie`¬†: Sends data back to the client to set on the cookie.
- `Data`¬†: If the request is successful, the body of the response will contain the resource you have requested.

### Tips-N-Tricks:

Here is a selection of common features for editing code. If the keyboard shortcuts aren‚Äôt comfortable for you, consider installing a [keymap extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Keymaps&sortBy=Downloads) for your old editor.

Tip: You can see recommended keymap extensions in the Extensions view with Ctrl+K Ctrl+M which filters the search to `@recommended:keymaps`.

### Multi cursor selection

To add cursors at arbitrary positions, select a position with your mouse and use Alt+Click (Option+click on macOS).

To set cursors above or below the current position use:

Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+Up or Ctrl+Alt+Down

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Le_oEOiYnEBmFfig.gif)

You can add additional cursors to all occurrences of the current selection with Ctrl+Shift+L.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WcrfwIln6NIG3zNW.gif)

> _Note: You can also change the modifier to Ctrl/Cmd for applying multiple cursors with the_ `editor.multiCursorModifier` [_setting_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)_¬†. See_ [_Multi-cursor Modifier_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multicursor-modifier) _for details._

If you do not want to add all occurrences of the current selection, you can use Ctrl+D instead. This only selects the next occurrence after the one you selected so you can add selections one by one.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*09EveaKtpZEKFEpO.gif)

### Column (box) selection

You can select blocks of text by holding Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on macOS) while you drag your mouse. A separate cursor will be added to the end of each selected line.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LrsOBXP4MVqr7aes.gif)

You can also use [keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_column-box-selection) to trigger column selection.

## [Object Oriented Programming in¬†JavaScript](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/13/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript/)

### Object-Oriented Programming

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*56wmllZ_9pRe28TK.jpg)

### Overview:

#### `Encapsulation`

- The mechanism that puts behavior and data together behind methods that hide the specific implementation of a class.

#### How can a `CommonJS Module import functionality` from another¬†module?

- Through the use of the require function.

#### How can an ES6 module import functionality from another¬†module?

- Through the use of the import-from syntax that looks like this:
- `import SymbolName from './relative-path.js';`

#### How do `CommonJS Modules` allow other modules to access exported¬†symbols?

- Through the use of the module.exports property.

#### How do `ES6 Modules export` functionality so other modules can use¬†them?

- Through the use of the export keyword.

#### `Implementation inheritance`

- The data and methods defined on a parent class are available on objects created from classes that inherit from those parent classes

#### `Inheritance`

- The mechanism that passes traits of a parent class to its descendants.

#### `Prototypal inheritance`

- A method of realizing implementation inheritance through process of finding missing properties on an object by delegating the resolution to a prototype object.

#### `The constructor method`

- The special method of a class that is called to initialize an object when code uses the new keyword to instantiate an object from that class.

#### `The Dependency Inversion Principle`

- Functionality that your class depends on should be provided as parameters to methods rather than using new in the class to create a new instance of a dependency.

#### The `extends`¬†keyword

- The keyword in JavaScript that allows one class to inherit from another.

#### `The Interface Segregation Principle`

- Method names should be grouped together into granular collections called ‚Äúinterfaces‚Äù

#### `The Law Of Demeter`

- Don‚Äôt use more than one dot (not counting the one after ‚Äúthis‚Äù).
- A method of an object can only invoke the methods (or use the properties) of the following kinds of objects: Methods on the object itself Any of the objects passed in as parameters to the method And object created in the method Any values stored in the instance variables of the object Any values stored in global variables

#### `The Liskov Substitution Principle`

- You can substitute child class objects for parent class objects and not cause errors.

#### `The Open-Close Principle`

- A class is open for extension and closed for modification.

#### `The Single-Responsibility Principle`

- Any one of the following:
- A class should do one thing and do it well.
- A class should have only one reason to change.
- Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons.

---

### Background:

### Constructor Functions

Defining a constructor function _Example of an object using object initialization_

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = {
      title: "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      series: "The Lord of the Rings",
      author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    };

- The above literal is a ‚ÄúBook‚Äù object type.
- `Object Type` is defined by it‚Äôs attributes and behaviors.

> `Behaviors` **are represented by methods.**

- `Constructor Functions`¬†: Handle the creation of an object ‚Äì it‚Äôs a factory for creating objects of a specific type.
- There are a few specific things to constructors worth noting:
- **_The name of the constructor function is capitalized_**
- The Function _does not explicitly return a value_
- Within the body, the _this_ keyword references the newly created object

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

### Invoking a constructor function

- We can invoke a constructor function using the `new` keyword.

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing); // Book { title: 'The Fellowship of the Ring', ... }

### _Four Things will happen when invoking a constructor function_

1.  A new empty object is created {};
2.  The new obj‚Äôs `prototype` is set to the object referenced by the constructors prototype property.
3.  `This` is bound to the new object.
4.  The new object is returned after the constructor function has completed.

### Understanding New Object Instances

- `Instance`¬†: term to describe an objected created from a constructor function.
- Every instance created is a unique object and therefore not equal to each other.

### Using the instanceof operator to check an object‚Äôs¬†type

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing instanceof Book); // true

- By using the `instanceof` operator we can verify that an object was created from a certain object type.
- _The instanceOf operator works by checking to see if the prototype object of the left side of the operator is the same as the prototype object of the right side of the operator._

### Invoking a constructor function without the new¬†keyword

- If we invoke a constructor function without the `new` keyword, we may result in one of two unexpected outcomes:

1.  In non-strict mode, this will be bound to the global object instead.
2.  In `strict` mode, this will become undefined.

- You can enable strict mode by typing `"use strict"` at the top of your file.

### Defining Sharable¬†Methods

- _Avoid the temptation to store an object method inside a constructor function, it is inefficient with computer memory usage b/c each object instance would have it‚Äôs own method definition._
- `Prototype`¬†: An object that is delegated to when a reference to an object property or method can‚Äôt be resolved.
- Every instance created by a constructor function shares the same prototype.
- `Object.setPrototypeOf()` and `Object.getPrototypeOf()` are just used to set a prototype of one object to another object; and also the verify a prototype.
- `proto`¬†: aka ‚Äúdunder proto‚Äù is a property used to gain easy access to an object‚Äôs prototype ‚Äì it is widely supported by browsers but is considered deprecated.

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

    // Any method defined on the `Book.prototype` property
    // will be shared across all `Book` instances.
    Book.prototype.getInformation = function () {
      return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;
    };

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing.getInformation());

- Every method we define on a constructor function‚Äôs prototype property will be shared across all instances of that object type.

The Problem with Arrow Functions

- We cannot use arrow functions when defining methods on a constructor function‚Äôs prototype property.
- Arrow functions don‚Äôt include their own this binding; therefore it will not reference the current instance‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalways stick with the function () keyword.

---

### Putting the Class in JavaScript Classes

In ES2015, JS gained the `class` keyword ‚Äì replacing the need to use only constructor functions & prototypes to mimic classes!

- `class`¬†: keyword that gives developers a formal way to create a class definition to specify an object type‚Äôs attributes and behavior; also used to create objects of that specific type.

Defining a ES2015 class

    class Book {
      constructor(title, series, author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.series = series;
        this.author = author;
      }
    }

- Class names also begin only with capital letters.
- Although not required, class definitions can include a `class constructor function` ‚Äì these are similar to regular constructors in that:
- They don‚Äôt explicitly return a value.
- The this keyword references the newly created object instance.

### Instantiating an instance of a¬†class

> We can also use the `new`.

### Four things occur when instantiating an instance of a¬†class:

1.  New empty object is created {};
2.  The new obj‚Äôs prototype is set to the class prototype‚Äôs property value.
3.  `This` is bound to the new object.
4.  After the constructor method has completed, the new obj is returned.

- **Don‚Äôt try to instatiate a class object without the new keyword.**

#### Class Definitions are NOT¬†hoisted

    test();

    function test() {
      console.log("This works!");
    }

- In JS you can call a function before it‚Äôs declared‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is known as `hoisting`.
- Class definitions are **NOT hoisted,** so just get in the habit of declaring them before you use them.

Defining Methods

- A class can contain two types of methods:
- `Instance Method`¬†: Methods that are invoked on an instance of the class ‚Äì useful for performing an action on a specific instance.
- Instance methods are also sometimes referred to as `prototype` methods because they are defined on a shared prototype object.
- `Static Method`¬†: Methods that invoked directly on a class, not on an instance.
- `Important`: Invoking a static method on an instance will result in a runtime error.
- Prepending the `static` keyword at the beginning on the method name will make it static.

<!-- -->

    class Book {
      constructor(title, series, author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.series = series;
        this.author = author;
      }

      // Notice the use of a rest parameter (...books)
      // to capture the passed parameters as an array of values.
      static getTitles(...books) {
        return books.map((book) => book.title);
      }

      getInformation() {
        return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;
      }
    }

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    const theTwoTowers = new Book(
      "The Two Towers",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    const bookTitles = Book.getTitles(fellowshipOfTheRing, theTwoTowers);

    console.log(bookTitles.join(", ")); // The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers

- If we go back to an example of how constructor functions also use static methods‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe see that static methods are *defined directly on the constructor function*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhereas instance methods need to be defined on the _prototype_ object.

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

    // Static methods are defined
    // directly on the constructor function.
    Book.getTitles = function (...books) {
      return books.map((book) => book.title);
    };

    // Instance methods are defined
    // on the constructor function's `prototype` property.
    Book.prototype.getInformation = function () {
      return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;
    };

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    const theTwoTowers = new Book(
      "The Two Towers",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing.getInformation()); // The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien

    console.log(theTwoTowers.getInformation()); // The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien

    // Call the static `Book.getTitles()` method
    // to get an array of the book titles.
    const bookTitles = Book.getTitles(fellowshipOfTheRing, theTwoTowers);

    console.log(bookTitles.join(", ")); // The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers

### Comparing Classes to Constructor Functions

> _ES2015 Classes are essentially_ **_syntactic sugar_** _over traditional constructor functions and prototypes._

---

### Javascript Inheritance

- `Child Class`¬†: Class that is based upon another class and inherits properties and methods from that other class.
- `Parent Class`¬†: Class that is being inherited downwards.
- `Inheritance`¬†: The process of basing a class upon another class.

<!-- -->

    class CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series) {
        this.title = title;
        this.series = series;
      }

      getInformation() {
        if (this.series) {
          return `${this.title} (${this.series})`;
        } else {
          return this.title;
        }
      }
    }

    class Book extends CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series, author) {
        super(title, series);
        this.author = author;
      }
    }

    class Movie extends CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series, director) {
        super(title, series);
        this.director = director;
      }
    }

    const theGrapesOfWrath = new Book(
      "The Grapes of Wrath",
      null,
      "John Steinbeck"
    );
    const aNewHope = new Movie(
      "Episode 4: A New Hope",
      "Star Wars",
      "George Lucas"
    );

    console.log(theGrapesOfWrath.getInformation()); // The Grapes of Wrath
    console.log(aNewHope.getInformation()); // Episode 4: A New Hope (Star Wars)
    console.log(Catalogitem instanceof Function); // true
    console.log(Book instanceof Function); // true

- A `prototype chain` defines a series of prototype objects that are delegated to one by one, when a property or method can‚Äôt be found on an instance object.

<!-- -->

    console.log(theGrapesOfWrath.getInformation()); // The Grapes of Wrath

- When the `getInformation()` method is invoked:
- JS looks for get() on the current object.
- If it isn‚Äôt found, the method call is delegated to the object‚Äôs prototype.
- It continues up the prototype chain until the method is found.

Overriding a method in a parent class

- `Method Overriding`¬†: when a child class provides an implementation of a method that‚Äôs already defined in a parent class.

<!-- -->

    class Movie extends CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series, director) {
        super(title, series);
        this.director = director;
      }

      getInformation() {
        let result = super.getInformation();

        if (this.director) {
          result += ` [directed by ${this.director}]`;
        }

        return result;
      }
    }

- We can simply declare our own method of the same name in our child class to override our parent‚Äôs version of `getInformation()`

---

### JavaScript Modules

Introducing Node.js modules

- In Node.js, each JS file in a project defines a `module`.
- Module‚Äôs contents are private by default.
- `Local Modules`¬†: Modules defined within your project.
- `Core Modules`¬†: Native modules contained within Node.js that you can use to perform tasks or to add functionality to your application.
- `CommonJS`¬†: A legacy module system.
- `ES Modules`¬†: Newer module sysem that will eventually replace CommonJS.
- `Entry Point`¬†: JS File that is passed to Node for access to the entire application.

### Syntax for exporting modules:

    module.exports.Book = Book; module.exports.Movie = Movie;

    module.exports = { Book, Movie, };

#### Syntax for importing modules:

    const classes = require(‚Äú./classes‚Äù);

    const { Book, Movie } = require(‚Äú./classes‚Äù);

#### Using Single Item¬†Modules

- Following the convention of a single exported item per module helps to keep modules focused and less likely to become bloted with too much code.

#### Understanding Module¬†Loading

- When loading a module, Node will examine the identifier passed to the require() function to determine if our module is local, core, or third-party:
- `Local Module`: identifier starts with¬†./¬†../ or /
- `Node.js Core`: identifier matches name
- `Third-Party`: identifier matches a module in the node modules folder (installed package)

---

### `Encapsulation`

- Puts the behavior and data together behind methods that hide the specific implementation so that code that uses it doesn‚Äôt need to worry about the details of it.

### `Inheritance`

- `Implementation Inheritance`**¬†:** Means that data and methods defined on a parent class are available on objects created from classes that inherit from those parent classes.
- `Prototypal Inheritance`¬†: Means that JS uses prototype objects to make its `implementation inheritance` actually work.
- Parent Class === Prototype === Super Class === Base Class
- Inheritance === Subtyping

<!-- -->

    class MyClass {}

    // is the same as
    class MyClass extends Object {}

- **When you declare a class with no explicit parent class, JS will make it a child of Object.**

<!-- -->

    class Charity {}

    class Business {
      toString() {
        return "Give us your money.";
      }
    }

    class Restaurant extends Business {
      toString() {
        return "Eat at Joe's!";
      }
    }

    class AutoRepairShop extends Business {}

    class Retail extends Business {
      toString() {
        return "Buy some stuff!";
      }
    }

    class ClothingStore extends Retail {}

    class PhoneStore extends Retail {
      toString() {
        return "Upgrade your perfectly good phone, now!";
      }
    }

    console.log(new PhoneStore().toString()); // 'Upgrade your perfectly good phone, now!'
    console.log(new ClothingStore().toString()); // 'Buy some stuff!';
    console.log(new Restaurant().toString()); // 'Eat at Joe\'s!'
    console.log(new AutoRepairShop().toString()); // 'Give us your money.'
    console.log(new Charity().toString()); // [object object]

#### The nuts and bolts of prototypal inheritance

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FCIE6k4O9X8f9CbR)

- When JavaScript uses a property (or method) from a prototype that it found through prototypal inheritance, then the this property points to the original object on which the first call was made.

<!-- -->

    class Parent {
      constructor() {
        this.name = "PARENT";
      }
      toString() {
        return `My name is ${this.name}`;
      }
    }

    class Child extends Parent {
      constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = "CHILD";
      }
    }

    const parent = new Parent();
    console.log(parent.toString()); // my name is Parent

    const child = new Child();
    console.log(child.toString()); // my name is Child

### Polymorphism

- The ability to treat an object as if it were an instance of one of its parent classes.

---

### The SOLID Principles Explained

SOLID is an anagram for:

- `The Single-Responsibility Principle`
- `The Open-Close Principle`
- `The Liskov Substitution Principle`
- `The Interface Segregation Principle`
- `The Dependency Inversion Principle`

### `Single-Responsibility Principle`

> _A class should do one thing and do it well_

- This principle is about limiting the impact of change.

### `The Liskov Substitution Principle:`

_Subtype Requirement: Let œï(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then œï(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T._

> _You can substitute child class objects for parent class objects and not cause errors._

`The Other Three`

- The remaining three principles are important for languages that have `static typing` ‚Äì which means a variable can have only one kind of thing in it.
- `Open-Close Principle`
- A class is open for extension and closed for modification.
- Creating new functionality can happen in child classes, and not the original class.
- `Interface Segregation Principle`
- Method names should be grouped together into granular collections called ‚Äúinterfaces‚Äù.
- `Dependency Inversion Principle`
- Functionality that your class depends on should be provided as parameters to methods rather than using new in the class to create a new instance.

### Controlling Coupling with The Law of¬†Demeter

- `Coupling`¬†: The degree of interdependence between two or more classes.
- The fewer the connections between classes, the less chance there is for the _ripple effect_.
- Here is the formal definition:
- A method of an object can only invoke the methods (or use the properties) of the following kind of objects:
- Methods on the object itself.
- Any of the objects passed in as parameters to the method.
- Any object created in the method.
- Any values stores in the instance variables of the object.
- Any values stored in global variables.
- Law of Demeter is more so of a guideline than a law.
- Easiest way to implement it is to _not us more than one dot_
- You cannot cheat by separating extra calls onto different lines.

### When to ignore the Law of¬†Demeter

- When you work with objects that come from code that you didn‚Äôt create‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou will often have to break the LoD.

<!-- -->

    document
      .getElementById("that-link")
      .addEventListener("click", (e) => e.preventDefault());

- This breaks the law but there is way about it because your code needs to know about both elements and you have to use the API provided by the DOM.
- UI‚Äôs will break LoD because they are not object-oriented programs.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*3_vbGvHeWOgSTxk7.png)

### Question

Write a function `rotateRight(array, num)` that takes in an array and a number as arguments.

> The function should return a new array where the elements of the array are rotated to the right number times.  
> The function should not mutate the original array and instead return a new array.

> Define this function using `function expression syntax`[.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)

**HINT:** you can use [Array\#slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) to create a copy of an array

---

> JavaScript gives us four methods to add or remove items from the beginning or end of arrays:

### pop(): Remove an item from the end of an¬†array

    let cats = ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Mini'];

    cats.pop(); // ['Bob', 'Willy']

> pop() returns the removed item.

### push(): Add items to the end of an¬†array

    let cats = ['Bob'];

    cats.push('Willy'); // ['Bob', 'Willy']

    cats.push('Puff', 'George'); // ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Puff', 'George']

> push() returns the new array length.

### shift(): Remove an item from the beginning of an¬†array

    let cats = ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Mini'];

    cats.shift(); // ['Willy', 'Mini']

> shift() returns the removed item.

### unshift(): Add items to the beginning of an¬†array

    let cats = ['Bob'];

    cats.unshift('Willy'); // ['Willy', 'Bob']

    cats.unshift('Puff', 'George'); // ['Puff', 'George', 'Willy', 'Bob']

> unshift() returns the new array length.

**We are being asked for two things:**

1.  To return an array with all the elements shifted over ‚Äònum‚Äô times.
2.  To `NOT` mutate the original array

**Step 1.**  
We need to start the function and create a variable to hold a COPY of our input array.

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/ca7a48c316345f6f7acd9383e13fb23e><https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice>

- We assign array.slice(0) to a variable called result.
- Slicing our input array simply creates a sliced copy of the data.
- Remember that by excluding a second argument in our slice parameter allows us to slice from the first argument all the way to the end.

**Step 2.**  
We need to create a for loop to tell our function how many times we want to rotate.

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/b2a934289a677f337a72bcd7751a55df>

- By setting our second delimiter to i &lt; num we will ask our loops to run num times.
- Running num times is the same as executing the code block within num times.

**Step 3.**  
We need to put some executable code within our for loop to be run during every cycle.

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/44e66960ba5cc0ffe04ea0499f7c3134>

- Since we are rotating to the right, every change to our result array under the hood will look like this (if we ref. our first test case):
- `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];` (how it looks like at the start)
- `['e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];` (after one run of the for loop)
- `['d', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c'];` (after second/last run of the for loop)
- To accomplish this we first need to ‚Äò`pop`‚Äò off or remove our last element.
- Two things happen when we use this built-in function.
- Our copied array is mutated to lose it‚Äôs last ele.
- The removed element is stored in the variable we assigned to the function.
- Our second step is to add it to the start of our array, to do this we can use `unshift`.
- By inputting the variable we are using to hold our removed element into the parameter of unshift we are adding our element to the front of the array.

**Step 4.**

Now that our for loop has ended and our copied array looks just like how the answer looks, we need to output the answer.

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/b033f820c35869af0869ce712af68bda>

- We accomplish this by creating a `return` line AFTER the for loop.

## [Super Simple Intro To¬†HTML](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/13/super-simple-intro-to-html/)

#### What is HTML, CSS & JS and why do we need all¬†three?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*KxF-AuqgX7UklUa4.png)

HTML stands for ‚ÄúHypertext Markup Language‚Äù. Basically, HTML is the structure for the website, words, bullet points, data tables, etc. CSS stands for ‚ÄúCascading Style Sheets‚Äù which means it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù it‚Äôs how to make your website look professional, and look visually appealing. JS is how to make your website actually \*\*work\*\*.

For example, if you created something like YouTube and one of the options you can watch videos, you used HTML for the title, you used CSS for the color/s, and you have to make it actually work! So when you click on it it will run the video. This is an example of the three programming languages working in unison to form an experience you‚Äôre already familiar with if you‚Äôre reading this‚Ä¶

**I mean most likely‚Ä¶ unless you printed it because you hate trees.**

‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää-

### What are Tags and Attributes?

Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

They work together but perform different functions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is worth investing 2 minutes in **differentiating the two**.

#### What Are HTML¬†Tags?

[Tags](https://html.com/tags/) are used to **mark up the start of an HTML element** and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: `<h1>`.

Most tags must be opened `<h1>` and closed `</h1>` in order to function.

#### What are HTML Attributes?

[Attributes](https://html.com/attributes/) contain **additional pieces of information**. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is **placed inside**.

An example of an attribute is:

`<img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">`

In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the `<img>` tag.

#### Golden Rules To¬†Remember

1.  The vast majority of tags must be **opened** (`<tag>`) and **closed** (`</tag>`) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
2.  When using multiple tags, the tags must be **closed in the order in which they were opened**. For example:
3.  `<strong><em>This is really important!</em></strong>`

Let‚Äôs have a look at how CodePen works, firstly, you need to go to their website. After that, you must create an account. After you do that, You will see something like this

### How to get¬†started

If you‚Äôre using Visual Studio Code, congrats! There is Emmet support built into VSCode, so you won‚Äôt need to install any extensions. If you‚Äôre working in Atom you‚Äôll need to install the Emmet plugin, which can be [found here](https://atom.io/packages/emmet).

### Basic Syntax

**_HTML Boilerplate_**

If you‚Äôve been working in VSCode, you‚Äôve probably seen Emmet syntax highlighting when working in HTML documents. In my opinion, the most convenient Emmet shortcut is **_html:5_**. This will create an HTML boilerplate, and fill out metadata tags in the head of your document.

    html:5

Emmet Abbreviation for different HTML boilerplates.

**When you see the auto complete as pictured above you can hit tab to auto fill the boilerplate html document.**

That one small shortcut autogenerates all this metadata and head and body tags:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LgiaI-W7QB4mtifR.png)

#### Here‚Äôs some slightly more advanced boilerplate for you to use as a starting point in your projects.

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/b0aae5c4079596820e37c98265f45539>

### HTML Language

**Chapter 1: Formatting text**

**Tags in HTML:** Tags are one of the most important parts in an HTML document. (We will get to what HTML document is after we know what tags are). HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, that is how to display a particular given content. For Example, to create a paragraph, one must use the paragraph tags(&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;) and to insert an image one must use the img tags(&lt;img /&gt;).

There are generally two types of tags in HTML:

1.  **Paired tags:** These tags come in pairs. That is they have both opening (&lt; &gt;) and closing(&lt;/ &gt;) tags.
2.  **Singular tags:** These tags do not required to be closed

> i.e.

    <hr>
    <p> The tag above me is a horizontal line that doesn't need a closing tag </p>

HTML tags have two main types: **block-level** and **inline tags**.

1.  Block-level elements take up the full available space and always start a new line in the document. Headings and paragraphs are a great example of block tags.
2.  Inline elements only take up as much space as they need and don‚Äôt start a new line on the page. They usually serve to format the inner contents of block-level elements. Links and emphasized strings are good examples of inline tags.

### Block-Level Tags

The three block level tags every HTML document needs to contain are **&lt;html&gt;**, **&lt;head&gt;**, and **&lt;body&gt;**.

1.  The **&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;** tag is the highest level element that encloses every HTML page.
2.  The **&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;** tag holds meta information such as the page‚Äôs title and charset.
3.  Finally, the **&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;** tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.

- Paragraphs are enclosed by **_&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;_**, while blockquotes use the **_&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;_** tag.
- Divisions are bigger content sections that typically contain several paragraphs, images, sometimes blockquotes, and other smaller elements. We can mark them up using the **_&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;_** tag. A div element can contain another div tag inside it as well.
- You may also use **_&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;_** tags for ordered lists and **_&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;_** for unordered ones. Individual list items must be enclosed by the **_&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;_** tag. For example, this is how a basic unordered list looks like in HTML:

1.  **&lt;ul&gt;**
2.  **&lt;li&gt;**List item 1**&lt;/li&gt;**
3.  **&lt;li&gt;**List item 2**&lt;/li&gt;**
4.  **&lt;li&gt;**List item 3**&lt;/li&gt;**
5.  **&lt;/ul&gt;**

### **Structure of an HTML¬†Document**

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts:

- **HEAD**: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta-Data etc.

HTML TAG Specifies an html document. The HTML element (or HTML root element) represents the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element. Since the element is the first in a document, it is called the root element.

Although this tag can be implied, or not required, with HTML, it is required to be opened and closed in XHTML.

- Divisions are bigger content sections that typically contain several paragraphs, images, sometimes blockquotes, and other smaller elements. We can mark them up using the **_&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;_** tag. A div element can contain another div tag inside it as well.
- You may also use **_&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;_** tags for ordered lists and **_&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;_** for unordered ones. Individual list items must be enclosed by the **_&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;_** tag. For example, this is how a basic unordered list looks like in HTML:

1.  **&lt;ul&gt;**
2.  **&lt;li&gt;**List item 1**&lt;/li&gt;**
3.  **&lt;li&gt;**List item 2**&lt;/li&gt;**
4.  **&lt;li&gt;**List item 3**&lt;/li&gt;**
5.  **&lt;/ul&gt;**

### Inline Tags

Many inline tags are used to format text. For example, a **&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;** tag would render an element in **bold**, whereas _&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;_ tags would show it in _italics_.

Hyperlinks are also inline elements that require **_&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;_** tags and **href** attributes to indicate the link‚Äôs destination:

1.  **&lt;a** **href=**‚Äùhttps://example.com/‚Äù**&gt;**Click me!**&lt;/a&gt;**

Images are inline elements too. You can add one using **_&lt;img&gt;_** without any closing tag. But you will also need to use the **_src_** attribute to specify the image path, for example:

1.  **&lt;img** **src=**‚Äù/images/example.jpg‚Äù **alt=**‚ÄùExample image‚Äù**&gt;**

#### **BODY**: This contains everything you want to display on the Web¬†Page.

    <body>

    <! ‚Äî Everything the user sees on the webpage goes here! ‚Äî ps‚Ä¶ this is a comment ‚Üí

    </body>

Let us now have a look on the basic structure of HTML. That is the code which is must for every webpage to have:

**_&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;_**

#### Here is some boilerplate html you can use as a starting point:!!Every Webpage must contain this¬†code.!!

---

### **&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;**

---

Below is the complete explanation of each of the tags used in the above piece of HTML code:

**&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;:** This tag is used to tells the HTML version. This currently tells that the version is HTML 5.

> **_&lt;html&gt;_:** This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.

> **&lt;head&gt;:** Head tag contains metadata, title, page CSS etc. All the HTML elements that can be used inside the &lt;head&gt; element are:

> **&lt;body&gt;:** Body tag is used to enclosed all the data which a web page has from texts to links. All of the content that you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element.

### Bold Text:

&lt;b&gt; **this is bold** &lt;/b&gt;

&lt;strong&gt; ‚áê this is for strong, emergency emotions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**HEADING/S:**

_6 types from largest(h1) to smallest (h6)_

&lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt; &lt;h5&gt; &lt;h6&gt;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ITALICS:** There are two ways to use it, the first one is the &lt;i&gt; tag and the second one is the &lt;em&gt; tag. They both italicize the text[ü§∑](https://emojipedia.org/person-shrugging/)

&lt;i&gt; _this is fancy text that‚Äôs too good to for us_&lt;/i&gt;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**PARAGRAPHS:** In order to make Paragraphs, just add &lt;p&gt;.

&lt;p&gt; Hi there my name is Jason. &lt;/p&gt;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TITLES: not the same thing as a heading (which renders on the html page) but instead the title element represents the title of the page as shown in the tab of the browser.**

&lt;head&gt;

As such &lt;title&gt;This is the title&lt;/title&gt; it is always found between &lt;head&gt; tags and not in the body of the page where all the content that gets rendered on the page is contained.

### Here‚Äôs a handy Cheat¬†Sheet:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*c9Vyer_N97InJsUB.png)

Below I am going to Include a gist that contains html code that uses pretty much every tag I could think of off the top of my head‚Ä¶

If it‚Äôs not included here I promise you it‚Äôs seldom used by most webpages.

Below that I will embed an image of the webpage that it renders too‚Ä¶.

## [Everything You Need To Know About Relational Databases, SQL, PostgreSQL and Sequelize To¬†Build‚Ä¶](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-relational-databases-sql-postgresql-and-sequelize-to-build/)

#### [CODEX](http://medium.com/codex)

**For Front end developers who like myself struggle with making the jump to fullstack.**

You can access and query the data using the findByPk, findOne, and findAll methods.

**Terminology:**

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) We re going to use this to run JavaScript code on the server. I ve decided to use the latest version of Node, v6.3.0 at the time of writing, so that we ll have access to most of the new features introduced in ES6.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) As per their website, Express is a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js¬†, that we re going to be building our Todo list application on.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/index.html) This is a powerful open-source database that we re going to use. I ve attached an article I published on the setup below!

[**PostgreSQL Setup For Windows & WSL/Ubuntu**  
_If you follow this guide to a tee you will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will_ bryanguner.medium.com](https://bryanguner.medium.com/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089 "https://bryanguner.medium.com/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089")

- However, if you face issues while installing PostgreSQL, or you don t want to dive into installing it, you can opt for a version of PostgreSQL hosted online. I recommend [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). I found it s pretty easy to get started with. However, the free version will only give you a 20MB allowance.
- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/) In addition, we re going to use Sequelize, which is a database [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) that will interface with the Postgres database for us.

**RDBMS and Database Entities**

**Define what a relational database management system is**

- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System
- A software application that you run that your programs can connect to so that they can store, modify, and retrieve data.
- An RDBMS can track many databases. We will use PostgreSQL, or postgres¬†, primarily for our RDBMS and it will be able to create individual databases for each of our projects.

**Describe what relational data is**

- In general, relational data is information that is connected to other pieces of information.
- When working with relational databases, we can connect two entries together utilizing foreign keys (explained below).
- In a pets database, we could be keeping track of dogs and cats as well as the toys that each of them own. That ownership of a cat to a toy is the relational aspect of relational data. Two pieces of information that can be connected together to show some sort of meaning.

**Define what a database is**

- The actual location that data is stored.
- A database can be made up of many tables that each store specific kinds of information.
- We could have a pets database that stores information about many different types of animals. Each animal type could potentially be represented by a different table.

**Define what a database table is**

- Within a database, a table stores one specific kind of information.
- The records (entries) on these tables can be connected to records on other tables through the use of foreign keys
- In our pets database, we could have a dogs table, with individual records

**Describe the purpose of a primary key**

- A primary key is used in the database as a unique identifier for the table.
- We often use an id field that simply increments with each entry. The incrementing ensures that each record has a unique identifier, even if their are other fields of the record that are repeated (two people with the same name would still need to have a unique identifier, for example).
- With a unique identifier, we can easily connect records within the table to records from other tables.

**Describe the purpose of a foreign key**

- A foreign key is used as the connector from this record to the primary key of another table s record.
- In our pets example, we can imagine two tables to demonstrate: a table to represent cats and a table to represent toys. Each of these tables has a primary key of id that is used as the unique identifier. In order to make a connection between a toy and a cat, we can add another field to the cat table called owner_id¬†, indicating that it is a foreign key for the cat table. By setting a toy s owner_id to the same value as a particular cat s id¬†, we can indicate that the cat is the owner of that toy.

**Describe how to properly name things in PostgreSQL**

- Names within postgres should generally consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Tables within a database are plural by convention, so a table for cats would typically be cats and office locations would be office_locations (all lowercase, underscores to replace spaces, plural)

**Connect to an instance of PostgreSQL with the command line tool psql**

- The psql command by default will try to connect to a database and username that matches your system s username
- We connect to a different database by providing an argument to the psql command
- psql pets
- To connect with a different username we can use the -U flag followed by the username we would like to use. To connect to the pets database as pets_user
- psql -U pets_user pets
- If there is a password for the user, we can tell psql that we would like a prompt for the password to show up by using the -W flag.
- psql -U pets_user -W pets (the order of our flags doesn t matter, as long as any arguments associated with them are together, such as pets_user directly following -U in this example)

**Identify whether a user is a normal user or a superuser by the prompt in the psql shell**

- You can tell if you are logged in as a superuser or normal user by the prompt in the terminal.
- If the prompt shows =&gt;, the user is a normal user
- If the prompt show =\#, the user is a superuser

**Create a user for the relational database management system**

- Within psql, we can create a user with the CREATE USER {username} {WITH options} command.
- The most common options we ll want to use are WITH PASSWORD ‚Äòmypassword‚Äô to provide a password for the user we are creating, CREATEDB to allow the user to create new databases, or SUPERUSER to create a user with all elevated permissions.

**Create a database in the database management system**

- We can use the command CREATE DATABASE {database name} {options} inside psql to create a new database.
- A popular option we may utilize is WITH OWNER {owner name} to set another user as the owner of the database we are making.

**Configure a database so that only the owner (and superusers) can connect to it**

- We can GRANT and REVOKE privileges from a database to users or categories of users.
- In order to remove connection privileges to a database from the public we can use REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM PUBLIC;, removing all public connection access.
- If we wanted to grant it back, or to a specific user, we could similarly do GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM {specific user, PUBLIC, etc.};

**View a list of databases in an installation of PostgreSQL**

- To list all databases we can use the \\l or \\list command in psql.

**Create tables in a database**

    CREATE TABLE {table name} (
    {columnA} {typeA},
    {columnB} {typeB},
    etc‚Ä¶
    );

- The whitespace does not matter. Creating the SQL statements on multiple lines is easier to read, but just like JavaScript, they can be presented differently.
- One common issue is that SQL does not like trailing commas, so the last column cannot have a comma after its type in this example.

**View a list of tables in a database**

- To list all database tables, use the \\dt command.

**Identify and describe the common data types used in PostgreSQL**

- There are many different data types that we can use in our tables, here are some common examples:
- SERIAL: autoincrementing, very useful for IDs
- VARCHAR(n): a string with a character limit of n
- TEXT: doesn t have character limit, but less performant
- BOOLEAN: true/false
- SMALLINT: signed two-byte integer (-32768 to 32767)
- INTEGER: signed four-byte integer (standard)
- BIGINT: signed eight-byte integer (very large numbers)
- NUMERIC: or DECIMAL, can store exact decimal values
- TIMESTAMP: date and time

**Describe the purpose of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, and create columns in database tables that have them**

- In addition to the data type, we can provide flags for constraints to place on our column data.
- The UNIQUE flag indicates that the data for the column must not be repeated.
- By default we can create entries in our tables that are missing data from columns. When creating a pet, maybe we don t provide an age because we don t know it, for example. If we want to require that the data be present in order to create a new record, we can indicate that column must be NOT NULL.
- In the example below, we are requiring our pets to have unique names and for them to be present (both UNIQUE and NOT NULL). We have no such constraints on the age column, allowing repetition of ages or their complete absence.

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE pets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age SMALLINT
    );

**Create a primary key for a table**

- When creating a table we can indicate the primary key by passing in the column name to parentheses like so:

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

- We could have also used the PRIMARY KEY flag on the column definition itself:

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

**Create foreign key constraints to relate tables**

- In our table definition, we can use the line FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_stored_in_this_table) REFERENCE {other table} ({other_tables_key_name}) to connect two tables.
- This is probably easier to see in an example:

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

    CREATE TABLE pets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age SMALLINT,
    person_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people (id)
    );

**SQL is not case sensitive for its keywords but is for its entity names**

- Exactly as the LO states, CREATE TABLE and create table are interpreted the same way. Using capitalization is a good convention in order to distinguish your keywords.
- The entity names that we use ARE case-sensitive, however. So a table named pets is unique from a table named Pets. In general, we prefer to use all lowercase for our entities to avoid any of this confusion.

**SQL**

1. How to use the SELECT¬†‚Ä¶ FROM¬†‚Ä¶ statement to select data from a single table

- Supply the column names in the SELECT clause. If we want all columns, we can also use \*
- Supply the table names in the FROM clause

‚Äî Selects all columns from the friends table

    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    friends;

‚Äî Selects the first_name column from the friends table (remember whitespace is ignored)  
SELECT name  
FROM friends;

- Sometimes we may need to specify what table we are selecting a column from, particulurly if we had joined multiple tables together.

‚Äî Notice here we are indicating that we want the ‚Äúname‚Äù field from the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù table as well as the ‚Äúname‚Äù field from the ‚Äúpuppies‚Äù table. We indicate the table name by table.column  
‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWe are also aliasing these fields with the AS keyword so that our returned results have friend_name and puppy_name as field headers

    SELECT
    friends.name AS friend_name , puppies.name AS puppy_name
    FROM
    friends
    JOIN
    puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id

**How to use the WHERE clause on SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to narrow the scope of the command**

- The WHERE clause allows us to select or apply actions to records that match specific criteria instead of to a whole table.
- We can use WHERE with a couple of different operators when making our comparison
- WHERE {column} = {value} provides an exact comparison
- WHERE {column} IN ({value1}, {value2}, {value3}, etc.) matches any provided value in the IN statement. We can make this more complex by having a subquery inside of the parentheses, having our column match any values within the returned results.
- WHERE {column} BETWEEN {value1} AND {value2} can check for matches between two values (numeric ranges)
- WHERE {column} LIKE {pattern} can check for matches to a string. This is most useful when we use the wildcard %, such as WHERE breed LIKE ‚Äò%Shepherd‚Äô, which will match any breed that ends in Shepherd
- The NOT operator can also be used for negation in the checks.
- Mathematical operators can be used when performing calculations or comparisons within a query as well, such as

<!-- -->

    SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs > 50; ‚Äî OR SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 5;

**How to use the JOIN keyword to join two (or more) tables together into a single virtual table**

- When we want to get information from a related table or do querying based on related table values, we can join the connected table by comparing the foreign key to where it lines up on the other table:

‚Äî Here we are joining the puppies table on to the friends table. We are specifying that the comparison we should make is the foreign key puppy_id on the friends table should line up with the primary key id on the puppies table.

    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    friends
    JOIN
    puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id

**How to use the INSERT statement to insert data into a table**

- When a table is already created we can then insert records into it using the INSERT INTO keywords.
- We provide the name of the table that we would like to add records to, followed by the VALUES keyword and each record we are adding. Here s an example:

‚Äî We are providing the table name, then multiple records to insert  
‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe values are listed in the order that they are defined on the table

    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES
    (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
    (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
    (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);

- We can also specify columns when we are inserting data. This makes it clear which fields we are providing data for and allows us to provide them out of order, skip null or default values, etc.

‚Äî In this example, we want to use the default value for id since it is autoincremented, so we provide DEFAULT for this field

    INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES
    (DEFAULT, ‚ÄòAmy‚Äô, ‚ÄòPond‚Äô);

‚Äî Alternatively, we can leave it out completely, since the default value will be used if none is provided

    INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
    VALUES
    (‚ÄòRose‚Äô, ‚ÄòTyler‚Äô),
    (‚ÄòMartha‚Äô, ‚ÄòJones‚Äô),
    (‚ÄòDonna‚Äô, ‚ÄòNoble‚Äô),
    (‚ÄòRiver‚Äô, ‚ÄòSong‚Äô);

**How to use an UPDATE statement to update data in a table**

- The UPDATE keyword can be used to find records and change their values in our database.
- We generally follow the pattern of UPDATE {table} SET {column} = {new value} WHERE {match condition};.
- Without a condition to narrow our records down, we will update every record in the table, so this is an important thing to double check!
- We can update multiple fields as well by specifying each column in parentheses and their associated new values: UPDATE {table} SET ({column1}, {column2}) = ({value1}, {value2}) WHERE {match condition};

‚Äî Updates the pet with id of 4 to change their name and breed

    UPDATE
    pets
    SET
    (name, breed) = (‚ÄòFloofy‚Äô, ‚ÄòFluffy Dog Breed‚Äô) WHERE id = 4;

**How to use a DELETE statement to remove data from a table**

- Similar to selecting records, we can delete records from a table by specifying what table we are deleting from and what criteria we would like to match in order to delete.
- We follow the general structure DELETE FROM {table} WHERE {condition};
- The condition here is also very important! Without a condition, all records match and will be deleted.

‚Äî Deletes from the pets table any record that either has a name Floofy, a name Doggo, or an id of 3.

    DELETE FROM
    pets
    WHERE
    name IN (‚ÄòFloofy‚Äô, ‚ÄòDoggo‚Äô) OR id = 3;

**How to use a seed file to populate data in a database**

- Seed files are a great way for us to create records that we want to start our database out with.
- Instead of having to individually add records to our tables or manually entering them in psql or postbird, we can create a file that has all of these records and then just pass this file to psql to run.
- Seed files are also great if we ever need to reset our database. We can clear out any records that we have by dropping all of our tables, then just run our seed files to get it into a predetermined starting point. This is great for our personal projects, testing environments, starting values for new tables we create, etc.
- There are two main ways we can use a seed file with psql, the &lt; and the | operators. They perform the same function for us, just in slightly different orders, taking the content of a¬†.sql file and executing in within the psql environment:
- psql -d {database} &lt; {sql filepath}
- cat {sql filepath} | psql -d {database}

**SQL (continued)**

**How to perform relational database design**

- Steps to Designing the Database:
- Define the entities. What data are are you storing, what are the fields for each entity?
- You can think of this in similar ways to OOP (object oriented programming).
- If you wanted to model this information using classes, what classes would you make? Those are generally going to be the tables that are created in your database.
- The attributes of your classes are generally going to be the fields/columns that we need for each table.
- Identify primary keys. Most of the time these will be ids that you can generate as a serial field, incrementing with each addition to the database.
- Establish table relationships. Connect related data together with foreign keys. Know how we store these keys in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.
- With a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, we are able to use a foreign key on the table to indicate the other specific record that it is connected to.
- With a many-to-many relationship, each record could be connected to multiple records, so we have to create a join table to connect these entities. A record on this join table connects a record from one table to a record from another table.

**How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or fail operation**

- We can define an explicit transaction using BEGIN and ending with either COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
- If any command inside the block fails, everything will be rolled back. We can also specify that we want to roll back at the end of the block instead of committing. We saw that this can be useful when analyzing operations that would manipulate our database.

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance ‚Äî 100.00
    WHERE name = ‚ÄòAlice‚Äô;
    UPDATE branches SET balance = balance ‚Äî 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‚ÄòAlice‚Äô);
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = ‚ÄòBob‚Äô;
    UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‚ÄòBob‚Äô);
    COMMIT;

    BEGIN;
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    UPDATE cities
    SET city = ‚ÄòNew York City‚Äô
    WHERE city = ‚ÄòNew York‚Äô;
    ROLLBACK;

**How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance**

- An index can help optimize queries that we have to run regularly. If we are constantly looking up records in a table by a particular field (such as username or phone number), we can add an index in order to speed up this process.
- An index maintains a sorted version of the field with a reference to the record that it points to in the table (via primary key). If we want to find a record based on a field that we have an index for, we can look through this index in a more efficient manner than having to scan through the entire table (generally O(log n) since the index is sorted, instead of O(n) for a sequential scan).
- To add an index to a field we can use the following syntax:

<!-- -->

    CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

- To drop an index we can do the following:

<!-- -->

    DROP INDEX index_name

- Making an index is not always the best approach. Indices allow for faster lookup, but slow down record insertion and the updating of associated fields, since we not only have to add the information to the table, but also manipulate the index.
- We generally wouldn t care about adding an index if:
- The tables are small
- We are updating the table frequently, especially the associated columns
- The column has many NULL values

**Explain what the EXPLAIN command is used for:**

- EXPLAIN gives us information about how a query will run (the query plan)
- It gives us an idea of how our database will search for data as well as a qualitative comparitor for how expensive that operation will be. Comparing the cost of two queries will tell us which one is more efficient (lower cost).
- We can also use the ANALYZE command with EXPLAIN, which will actually run the specified query. Doing so gives us more detailed information, such as the milliseconds it took our query to execute as well as specifics like the exact number of rows filtered and returned.

1. Demonstrate how to install and use the node-postgres library and its Pool class to query a PostgreSQL-managed database

- We can add the node-postgres library to our application with npm install pg. From there we will typically use the Pool class associated with this library. That way we can run many SQL queries with one database connection (as opposed to Client, which closes the connection after a query).

<!-- -->

    const { Pool } = require(‚Äòpg‚Äô);

// If we need to specify a username, password, or database, we can do so when we create a Pool instance, otherwise the default values for logging in to psql are used:

    const pool = new Pool({ username: ‚Äò<<username>>‚Äô, password: ‚Äò<<password>>‚Äô, database: ‚Äò<<database>>‚Äô})

- The query method on the Pool instance will allow us to execute a SQL query on our database. We can pass in a string that represents the query we want to run

<!-- -->

    const allAirportsSql = `
    SELECT id, city_id, faa_id, name
    FROM airports;
    `;

    async function selectAllAirports() {
    const results = await pool.query(allAirportsSql);
    console.log(results.rows);
    pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database
    }

selectAllAirports();

- The return value of this asynchronous function is an object with a rows key that points to an array of objects, each object representing a record with field names as keys.

**Explain how to write prepared statements with placeholders for parameters of the form $1¬†, $2¬†, and so on**

- The prepared statement (SQL string that we wrote) can also be made more dynamic by allowing for parameters to be passed in.
- The Pool instance s query function allows us to pass a second argument, an array of parameters to be used in the query string. The location of the parameter substitutions are designated with $1, $2, etc., to signify the first, second, etc., arguments.

<!-- -->

    const airportsByNameSql = `
    SELECT name, faa_id
    FROM airports
    WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE UPPER($1)
    `;

async function selectAirportsByName(name) {  
const results = await pool.query(airportsByNameSql, \[ \`%${name}%\` \]);  
console.log(results.rows);  
pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database  
}

    // Get the airport name from the command line and store it
    // in the variable ‚Äúname‚Äù. Pass that value to the
    // selectAirportsByName function.
    const name = process.argv[2];
    // console.log(name);
    selectAirportsByName(name);

**ORM**

1. How to install, configure, and use Sequelize, an ORM for JavaScript

- To start a new project we use our standard npm initialize statement
- npm init -y
- Add in the packages we will need (sequelize, sequelize-cli, and pg)
- npm install sequelize@‚Åµ.0.0 sequelize-cli@‚Åµ.0.0 pg@‚Å∏.0.0
- Initialize sequelize in our project
- npx sequelize-cli init
- Create a database user with credentials we will use for the project
- psql
- CREATE USER example_user WITH PASSWORD ‚Äòbadpassword‚Äô
- Here we can also create databases since we are already in postgres

<!-- -->

    CREATE DATABASE example_app_development WITH OWNER example_user

    CREATE DATABASE example_app_test WITH OWNER example_user

    CREATE DATABASE example_app_production WITH OWNER example_user

- If we don t create these databases now, we could also create them after we make our changes to our config file. If we take this approach, we need to make sure our user that we created has the CREATEDB option when we make them, since sequelize will attempt to make the databases with this user. This other approach would look like:
- In psql: CREATE USER example_user WITH PASSWORD ‚Äòbadpassword‚Äô CREATEDB
- In terminal: npx sequelize-cli db:create
- Double check that our configuration file matches our username, password, database, dialect, and seederStorage (these will be filled out for you in an assessment scenario):

<!-- -->

    {
    ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù: {
    ‚Äúusername‚Äù: ‚Äúsequelize_recipe_box_app‚Äù,
    ‚Äúpassword‚Äù: ‚ÄúHfKfK79k‚Äù,
    ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù: ‚Äúrecipe_box_development‚Äù,
    ‚Äúhost‚Äù: ‚Äú127.0.0.1‚Äù,
    ‚Äúdialect‚Äù: ‚Äúpostgres‚Äù,
    ‚ÄúseederStorage‚Äù: ‚Äúsequelize‚Äù
    },
    ‚Äútest‚Äù: {
    ‚Äúusername‚Äù: ‚Äúsequelize_recipe_box_app‚Äù,
    ‚Äúpassword‚Äù: ‚ÄúHfKfK79k‚Äù,
    ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù: ‚Äúrecipe_box_test‚Äù,
    ‚Äúhost‚Äù: ‚Äú127.0.0.1‚Äù,
    ‚Äúdialect‚Äù: ‚Äúpostgres‚Äù,
    ‚ÄúseederStorage‚Äù: ‚Äúsequelize‚Äù
    },
    ‚Äúproduction‚Äù: {
    ‚Äúusername‚Äù: ‚Äúsequelize_recipe_box_app‚Äù,
    ‚Äúpassword‚Äù: ‚ÄúHfKfK79k‚Äù,
    ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù: ‚Äúrecipe_box_production‚Äù,
    ‚Äúhost‚Äù: ‚Äú127.0.0.1‚Äù,
    ‚Äúdialect‚Äù: ‚Äúpostgres‚Äù,
    ‚ÄúseederStorage‚Äù: ‚Äúsequelize‚Äù
    }
    }

1. How to use database migrations to make your database grow with your application in a source-control enabled way

**Migrations**

- In order to make new database tables and sequelize models that reflect them, we want to generate a migration file and model file using model:generate

<!-- -->

    npx sequelize-cli model:generate ‚Äî name Cat ‚Äî attributes ‚ÄúfirstName:string,specialSkill:string‚Äù

- Here we are creating a migration file and a model file for a Cat. We are specifying that we want this table to have fields for firstName and specialSkill. Sequelize will automatically make fields for an id, createdAt, and updatedAt, as well, so we do not need to specify these.
- Once our migration file is created, we can go in and edit any details that we need to. Most often we will want to add in database constraints such as allowNull: false, adding a uniqueness constraint with unique: true, adding in character limits to fields such as type: Sequelize.STRING(100), or specifying a foreign key with references to another table references: { model: ‚ÄòCategories‚Äô }.
- After we make any necessary changes to our migration file, we need to perform the migration, which will run the SQL commands to actually create the table.

<!-- -->

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

- This command runs any migration files that have not been previously run, in the order that they were created (this is why the timestamp in the file name is important)
- If we realize that we made a mistake after migrating, we can undo our previous migration, or all of our migrations. After undoing them, we can make any changes necessary to our migration files (They won t be deleted from the undo, so we don t need to generate anything! Just make the necessary changes to the files that already exist and save the files.). Running the migrations again will make the tables with the updates reflected.

<!-- -->

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

**Models Validations and Associations**

- In addition to the migration files, our model:generate command also created a model file for us. This file is what allows sequelize to transform the results of its SQL queries into useful JavaScript objects for us.
- The model is where we can specify a validation that we want to perform before trying to run a SQL query. If the validation fails, we can respond with a message instead of running the query, which can be an expensive operation that we know won t work.

<!-- -->

    // Before we make changes, sequelize generates the type that this field represents specification:
    DataTypes.TEXT
    // We can replace the generated format with an object to specify not only the type, but the validations that we want to implement. The validations can also take in messages the respond with on failure and arguments.
    specification: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        validate: {
            notEmpty: {
                msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
            },
            len: {
                args: [10, 100]
                msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
            }
        }
    }

- Another key part of the model file is setting up our associations. We can use the belongsTo, hasMany, and belongsToMany methods to set up model-level associations. Doing so is what creates the helpful functionality like addOwner that we saw in the pets example, a function that automatically generates the SQL necessary to create a petOwner record and supplies the appropriate petId and ownerId.
- In a one-to-many association, we need to have a belongsTo association on the many side, and a hasMany association on the one side:
- Instruction.belongsTo(models.Recipe, { foreignKey: ‚ÄòrecipeId‚Äô });
- Recipe.hasMany(models.Instruction, { foreignKey: ‚ÄòrecipeId‚Äô });
- In a many-to-many association, we need to have a belongsToMany on each side of the association. We generally specify a columnMapping object to show the association more clearly:

<!-- -->

    // In our Owner model

    // To connect this Owner to a Pet through the PetOwner

    const columnMapping = {

    through: ‚ÄòPetOwner‚Äô,

    // joins table

    otherKey: ‚ÄòpetId‚Äô,

    // key that connects to other table we have a many association with foreignKey: ‚ÄòownerId‚Äô

    // our foreign key in the joins table

    }

    Owner.belongsToMany( models.Pet, columnMapping );

    // In our Pet model

    // To connect this Pet to an Owner through the PetOwner

    const columnMapping = { through: ‚ÄòPetOwner‚Äô,

    // joins table

    otherKey: ‚ÄòownerId‚Äô,

    // key that connects to other table we have a many association with

    foreignKey: ‚ÄòpetId‚Äô

    // our foreign key in the joins table

    }

    Pet.belongsToMany( models.Owner, columnMapping );

### **How to perform CRUD operations with Sequelize**

- Seed Files
- Seed files can be used to populate our database with starter data.
- npx sequelize-cli seed:generate‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääname add-cats
- up indicates what to create when we seed our database, down indicates what to delete if we want to unseed the database.
- For our up, we use the queryInterface.bulkInsert() method, which takes in the name of the table to seed and an array of objects representing the records we want to create:

<!-- -->

    up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
        return queryInterface.bulkInsert('<<TableName>>', [{
            field1: value1a,
            field2: value2a
        }, {
            field1: value1b,
            field2: value2b
        }, {
            field1: value1c,
            field2: value2c
        }]);
    }

- For our down, we use the queryInterface.bulkDelete() method, which takes in the name of the table and an object representing our WHERE clause. Unseeding will delete all records from the specified table that match the WHERE clause.

<!-- -->

    // If we want to specify what to remove:
    down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‚Äò<<TableName>>‚Äô, {
    field1: [value1a, value1b, value1c], //‚Ä¶etc.
    });
    };
    // If we want to remove everything from the table:
    down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‚Äò<<TableName>>‚Äô, null, {});
    };

- Running npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all will run all of our seeder files.
- npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all will undo all of our seeding.
- If we omit the¬†:all we can run specific seed files
- Inserting with Build and Create
- In addition to seed files, which we generally use for starter data, we can create new records in our database by using build and save, or the combined create
- Use the¬†.build method of the Cat model to create a new Cat instance in index.js

<!-- -->

    // Constructs an instance of the JavaScript `Cat` class. **Does not
    // save anything to the database yet**. Attributes are passed in as a
    // POJO.
    const newCat = Cat.build({
        firstName: 'Markov',
        specialSkill: 'sleeping',
        age: 5
    });
    // This actually creates a new `Cats` record in the database. We must
    // wait for this asynchronous operation to succeed.
    await newCat.save();
    // This builds and saves all in one step. If we don't need to perform any operations on the instance before saving it, this can optimize our code.
    const newerCat = await Cat.create({
        firstName: 'Whiskers',
        specialSkill: 'sleeping',
        age: 2
    })

**Updating Records**

- When we have a reference to an instance of a model (i.e. after we have queried for it or created it), we can update values by simply reassigning those fields and using the save method

**Deleting Records**

- When we have a reference to an instance of a model, we can delete that record by using destroy
- const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1); // Remove the Markov record. await cat.destroy();
- We can also call destroy on the model itself. By passing in an object that specifies a where clause, we can destroy all records that match that query
- await Cat.destroy({ where: { specialSkill: ‚Äòjumping‚Äô } });

**How to query using Sequelize**

**findAll**

    const cats = await Cat.findAll();
    // Log the fetched cats.
    // The extra arguments to stringify are a replacer and a space respectively
    // Here we're specifying a space of 2 in order to print more legibly
    // We don't want a replacer, so we pass null just so that we can pass a 3rd argument
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

**WHERE clause**

- Passing an object to findAll can add on clauses to our query
- The where key takes an object as a value to indicate what we are filtering by
- { where: { field: value } } =&gt; WHERE field = value

<!-- -->

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: ‚ÄúMarkov‚Äù } }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

**OR in the WHERE clause**

- Using an array for the value tells sequelize we want to match any of these values

{ where: { field: \[value1, value2\] } =&gt; WHERE field IN (value1, value2)

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: [‚ÄúMarkov‚Äù, ‚ÄúCurie‚Äù] } });const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            firstName: "Markov",
            age: 4
        }
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

**AND in the WHERE clause**

- Providing additional key/value pairs to the where object indicates all filters must match
- { where: { field1: value1, field2: value2 } } =&gt; WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2

### Sequelize Op¬†operator

- By requiring Op from the sequelize library we can provide more advanced comparison operators
- const { Op } = require(‚Äúsequelize‚Äù);
- Op.ne: Not equal operator

<!-- -->

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            firstName: {
                // All cats where the name is not equal to "Markov"
                // We use brackets in order to evaluate Op.ne and use the value as the key
                [Op.ne]: "Markov"
            },
        },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

### Op.and: and¬†operator

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            // The array that Op.and points to must all be true
            // Here, we find cats where the name is not "Markov" and the age is 4
            [Op.and]: [{
                firstName: {
                    [Op.ne]: "Markov"
                }
            }, {
                age: 4
            }, ],
        },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

### Op.or: or¬†operator

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            // One condition in the array that Op.or points to must be true
            // Here, we find cats where the name is "Markov" or where the age is 4
            [Op.or]: [{
                firstName: "Markov"
            }, {
                age: 4
            }, ],
        },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

Op.gt and Op.lt: greater than and less than operators

const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { // Find all cats where the age is greater than 4 age: { \[Op.gt\]: 4 }, } }, }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

#### Ordering results

- Just like the where clause, we can pass an order key to specify we want our results ordered
- The key order points to an array with the fields that we want to order by
- By default, the order is ascending, just like standard SQL. If we want to specify descending, we can instead use a nested array with the field name as the first element and DESC as the second element. (We could also specify ASC as a second element in a nested array, but it is unnecessary as it is default)
- const cats = await Cat.findAll({ // Order by age descending, then by firstName ascending if cats have the same age order: \[\[‚Äúage‚Äù, ‚ÄúDESC‚Äù\], ‚ÄúfirstName‚Äù\], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

<!-- -->

    // Get a reference to the cat record that we want to update (here just the cat with primary key of 1)
    const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1);
    // Change cat's attributes.
    cat.firstName = "Curie";
    cat.specialSkill = "jumping";
    cat.age = 123;
    // Save the new name to the database.
    await cat.save();

- Limiting results
- We can provide a limit key in order to limit our results to a specified number

<!-- -->

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        order: [
            ["age", "DESC"]
        ],
        // Here we are limiting our results to one record. It will still return an array, just with one object inside. We could have said any number here, the result is always an array.
        limit: 1,
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

### findOne

- If we only want one record to be returned we can use findOne instead of findAll
- If multiple records would have matched our findOne query, it will return the first record
- Unlike findAll, findOne will return the object directly instead of an array. If no records matched the query it will return null.

<!-- -->

    // finds the oldest cat const cat = await Cat.findOne({ order: [[‚Äúage‚Äù, ‚ÄúDESC‚Äù]], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cat, null, 2));

- **Querying with Associations**

We can include associated data by adding an include key to our options object

    const pet = Pet.findByPk(1, {
        include: [PetType, Owner]
    });
    console.log(pet.id, pet.name, pet.age, pet.petTypeId, pet.PetType.type, pet.Owners

We can get nested associations by having include point to an object that specifies which model we have an association with, then chaining an association on with another include

**How to perform data validations with Sequelize**

- See the database migrations section above.
- In general, we add in a validate key to each field that we want validations for. This key points to an object that specifies all of the validations we want to make on that field, such as notEmpty, notNull, len, isIn, etc.

<!-- -->

    specification: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        validate: {
            notEmpty: {
                msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
            },
            len: {
                args: [10, 100]
                msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
            }
        }
    }

**How to use transactions with Sequelize**

- We can create a transaction block in order to make sure either all operations are performed or none of them are
- We use the¬†.transaction method in order to create our block. The method takes in a callback with an argument to track our transaction id (typically just a simple tx variable).
- All of our sequelize operations can be passed a transaction key on their options argument which points to our transaction id. This indicates that this operation is part of the transaction block and should only be executed in the database when the whole block executes without error.

<!-- -->

    async function main() {
        try {
            // Do all database access within the transaction.
            await sequelize.transaction(async (tx) => {
                // Fetch Markov and Curie's accounts.
                const markovAccount = await BankAccount.findByPk(
                    1, {
                        transaction: tx
                    },
                );
                const curieAccount = await BankAccount.findByPk(
                    2, {
                        transaction: tx
                    }
                );
                // No one can mess with Markov or Curie's accounts until the
                // transaction completes! The account data has been locked!
                // Increment Curie's balance by $5,000.
                curieAccount.balance += 5000;
                await curieAccount.save({
                    transaction: tx
                });
                // Decrement Markov's balance by $5,000.
                markovAccount.balance -= 5000;
                await markovAccount.save({
                    transaction: tx
                });
            });
        } catch (err) {
            // Report if anything goes wrong.
            console.log("Error!");
            for (const e of err.errors) {
                console.log(
                    `${e.instance.clientName}: ${e.message}`
                );
            }
        }
        await sequelize.close();
    }
    main();

### Sequelize Cheatsheet

#### Command Line

Sequelize provides utilities for generating migrations, models, and seed files. They are exposed through the `sequelize-cli` command.

#### Init Project

    $ npx sequelize-cli init

You must create a database user, and update the `config/config.json` file to match your database settings to complete the initialization process.

#### Create Database

    npx sequelize-cli db:create

#### Generate a model and its migration

    npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name <ModelName> --attributes <column1>:<type>,<column2>:<type>,...

#### Run pending migrations

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

#### Rollback one migration

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

#### Rollback all migrations

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

#### Generate a new seed¬†file

    npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name <descriptiveName>

#### Run all pending¬†seeds

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

#### Rollback one¬†seed

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo

#### Rollback all¬†seeds

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all

#### Migrations

### Create Table (usually used in the up()¬†method)

    // This uses the short form for references
    return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
        <columnName>: {
            type: Sequelize.<type>,
            allowNull: <true|false>,
            unique: <true|false>,
            references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                                // that the column references.
        }
    });
    // This the longer form for references that is less confusing
    return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
        <columnName>: {
            type: Sequelize.<type>,
            allowNull: <true|false>,
            unique: <true|false>,
            references: {
                model: {
                    tableName: <TableName> // This is the plural table name
                }
            }
        }
    });

### Delete Table (usually used in the down() function)

    return queryInterface.dropTable(<TableName>);

### Adding a¬†column

    return queryInteface.addColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>: {
        type: Sequelize.<type>,
        allowNull: <true|false>,
        unique: <true|false>,
        references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                            // that the column references.
    });

### Removing a¬†column

    return queryInterface.removeColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>);

### Model Associations

### One to One between Student and Scholarship

`student.js`

    Student.hasOne(models.Scholarship, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

`scholarship.js`

    Scholarship.belongsTo(models.Student, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

### One to Many between Student and¬†Class

`student.js`

    Student.belongsTo(models.Class, { foreignKey: 'classId' });

`class.js`

    Class.hasMany(models.Student, { foreignKey: 'classId' });

### Many to Many between Student and Lesson through StudentLessons table

`student.js`

    const columnMapping = {
        through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
        otherKey: 'lessonId',
        foreignKey: 'studentId'
    }
    Student.belongsToMany(models.Lesson, columnMapping);

`lesson.js`

    const columnMapping = {
        through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
        otherKey: 'studentId',
        foreignKey: 'lessonId'
    }
    Lesson.belongsToMany(models.Student, columnMapping);

### Inserting a new¬†item

    // Way 1 - With build and save
    const pet = Pet.build({
        name: "Fido",
        petTypeId: 1
    });
    await pet.save();
    // Way 2 - With create
    const pet = await Pet.create({
        name: "Fido",
        petTypeId: 1
    });

### Updating an¬†item

    // Find the pet with id = 1
    const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
    // Way 1
    pet.name = "Fido, Sr."
    await pet.save;
    // Way 2
    await pet.update({
        name: "Fido, Sr."
    });

### Deleting a single¬†item

    // Find the pet with id = 1
    const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
    // Notice this is an instance method
    pet.destroy();

### Deleting multiple¬†items

    // Notice this is a static class method
    await Pet.destroy({
        where: {
            petTypeId: 1 // Destorys all the pets where the petType is 1
        }
    });

### Query Format

### findOne

    await <Model>.findOne({
        where: {
            <column>: {
                [Op.<operator>]: <value>
            }
        },
    });

### findAll

    await <Model>.findAll({
        where: {
            <column>: {
                [Op.<operator>]: <value>
            }
        },
        include: <include_specifier>,
        offset: 10,
        limit: 2
    });

### findByPk

    await <Model>.findByPk(<primary_key>, {
        include: <include_specifier>
    });

### Eager loading associations with¬†`include`

Simple include of one related model.

    await Pet.findByPk(1,  {
            include: PetType
        })

Include can take an array of models if you need to include more than one.

    await Pet.findByPk(1, {
            include: [Pet, Owner]
        })

Include can also take an object with keys `model` and `include`.  
This is in case you have nested associations.  
In this case Owner doesn‚Äôt have an association with PetType, but  
Pet does, so we want to include PetType onto the Pet Model.

    await Owner.findByPk(1, {
            include: {
                model: Pet
                include: PetType
            }
        });

### toJSON method

The confusingly named toJSON() method does **not** return a JSON string but instead  
returns a POJO for the instance.

    // pet is an instance of the Pet class
    const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
    console.log(pet) // prints a giant object with
                     // tons of properties and methods
    // petPOJO is now just a plain old Javascript Object
    const petPOJO = pet.toJSON();
    console.log(petPOJO); // { name: "Fido", petTypeId: 1 }

### Common Where Operators

    const Op = Sequelize.Op
    [Op.and]: [{a: 5}, {b: 6}] // (a = 5) AND (b = 6)
    [Op.or]: [{a: 5}, {a: 6}]  // (a = 5 OR a = 6)
    [Op.gt]: 6,                // > 6
    [Op.gte]: 6,               // >= 6
    [Op.lt]: 10,               // < 10
    [Op.lte]: 10,              // <= 10
    [Op.ne]: 20,               // != 20
    [Op.eq]: 3,                // = 3
    [Op.is]: null              // IS NULL
    [Op.not]: true,            // IS NOT TRUE
    [Op.between]: [6, 10],     // BETWEEN 6 AND 10
    [Op.notBetween]: [11, 15], // NOT BETWEEN 11 AND 15
    [Op.in]: [1, 2],           // IN [1, 2]
    [Op.notIn]: [1, 2],        // NOT IN [1, 2]
    [Op.like]: '%hat',         // LIKE '%hat'
    [Op.notLike]: '%hat'       // NOT LIKE '%hat'
    [Op.iLike]: '%hat'         // ILIKE '%hat' (case insensitive) (PG only)
    [Op.notILike]: '%hat'      // NOT ILIKE '%hat'  (PG only)
    [Op.startsWith]: 'hat'     // LIKE 'hat%'
    [Op.endsWith]: 'hat'       // LIKE '%hat'
    [Op.substring]: 'hat'      // LIKE '%hat%'
    [Op.regexp]: '^[h|a|t]'    // REGEXP/~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
    [Op.notRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]' // NOT REGEXP/!~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
    [Op.iRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]'    // ~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
    [Op.notIRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]' // !~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
    [Op.like]: { [Op.any]: ['cat', 'hat']}

### Accessing the¬†Data

You can access and query the data using the `findByPk`, `findOne`, and `findAll` methods. First, make sure you import the models in your JavaScript file. In this case, we are assuming your JavaScript file is in the root of your project and so is the models folder.

    const { Recipe, Ingredient, Instruction, MeasurementUnit } = require('./models');

The models folder exports each of the models that you have created. We have these four in our data model, so we will destructure the models to access each table individually. The associations that you have defined in each of your models will allow you to access data of related tables when you query your database using the `include` option.

If you want to find all recipes, for the recipe list, you would use the `findAll` method. You need to await this, so make sure your function is async.

    async function findAllRecipes() {

    return await Recipe.findAll();

    }

If you would like to include all the ingredients so you can create a shopping list for all the recipes, you would use `include`. This is possible because of the association you have defined in your Recipe and Ingredient models.

    async function getShoppingList() {

    return await Recipe.findAll({ include: [ Ingredient ] });

    }

If you only want to find one where there is chicken in the ingredients list, you would use `findOne` and `findByPk`.

    async function findAChickenRecipe() {

    const chickenRecipe = await Ingredient.findOne({

    where: {

    foodStuff: 'chicken'

    }

    });

    return await Recipe.findByPk(chickenRecipe.recipeId);

    }

### Data Access to Create/Update/Delete Rows

You have two options when you want to create a row in a table (where you are saving one record into the table). You can either¬†`.build` the row and then¬†`.save` it, or you can¬†`.create` it. Either way it does the same thing. Here are some examples:

Let‚Äôs say we have a form that accepts the name of the recipe (for simplicity). When we get the results of the form, we can:

    const newRecipe = await Recipe.build({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });

    await newRecipe.save();

This just created our new recipe and added it to our Recipes table. You can do the same thing like this:

    await Recipe.create({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });

If you want to modify an item in your table, you can use `update`. Let‚Äôs say we want to change the chicken noodle soup to chicken noodle soup with extra veggies, first we need to get the recipe, then we can update it.

    const modRecipe = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' } });

    await modRecipe.update({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' });

To delete an item from your table, you will do the same kind of process. Find the recipe you want to delete and `destroy` it, like this:

    const deleteThis = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' } });

    await deleteThis.destroy();

**NOTE:** If you do not await these, you will receive a promise, so you will need to use¬†`.then` and¬†`.catch` to do more with the items you are accessing and modifying.

### Documentation

For the data types and validations in your models, here are the official docs. The sequelize docs are hard to look at, so these are the specific sections with just the lists:  
**Sequelize Data Types:** [_https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html_](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html)  
**Validations:** [_https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html\#validations_](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations)  
When you access the data in your queries, here are the operators available, again because the docs are hard to navigate, this is the specific section with the list of operators.  
**Operators:** [_https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html\#operators_](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators)  
The documentation for building, saving, creating, updating and destroying is linked here, it does a pretty good job of explaining in my opinion, it just has a title that we have not been using in this course. When they talk about an instance, they mean an item stored in your table.  
**Create/Update/Destroy:** [_https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html_](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html)

For More Advanced Readers, or those with very limited free time‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs an abridged Git Reference.

<https://bryanguner.medium.com/git-tricks-57e8d0292285>

### What‚Äôs a distributed version control¬†system?

Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs like Git don‚Äôt need a constant connection to a central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.

Without version control, team members are subject to redundant tasks, slower timelines, and multiple copies of a single project. To eliminate unnecessary work, Git and other VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that‚Äôs already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working independently.

### Why Git?

According to the latest [Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology), more than 70 percent of developers use Git, making it the most-used VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development, **with significant benefits** for individuals, teams and businesses.

- Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
- Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git, collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production code.
- Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate on major projects.

### What‚Äôs a repository?

A _repository_, or [Git project](https://git-scm.com/), encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file‚Äôs revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called _commits_, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called _branches_. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.

Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.

### Git Flow

### Cloning a repo and changing the remote¬†url

(These steps are only for when you initially clone a project repo. Not when you clone your partners repo to collaborate together. To do that, you only have to complete step 1!)

### 1. The first step is to clone the¬†repo!

- Navigate to the repo you want to clone and hit the big green code button. Copy the link given.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*63LoanrbOPBIwDC6oFarFA.png)

- Navigate in your terminal to the directory where you want this repo to live. I‚Äôve chosen downloads
- `git clone HTTPS://LINKTOURL/THATYOUCOPIED`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PRiaHOvU-wvpAYQtIqduGQ.png)

### 2. Sweet, you have the cloned repo in your preferred directory. Now lets make your own repo. On github, create a new repository.

- Default settings are fine. Hit the big green button `Create Repository`

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*U1qwd0OEBYhcToXYt2i6iA.png)

### 3. Next,

**_copy the¬†.git link that is on the next page. Do not do any other steps on this page‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThat is for when you do not clone a repo._**

---

### These are the commands GitHub provides when you create a new¬†Repo:

#### Quick setup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif you‚Äôve done this kind of thing¬†before

Set up in Desktop

or

HTTPSSSH

Get started by [creating a new file](https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42/new/master) or [uploading an existing file](https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42/upload). We recommend every repository include a [README](https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42/new/master?readme=1), [LICENSE](https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42/new/master?filename=LICENSE.md), and¬†[.gitignore](https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42/new/master?filename=.gitignore).

### ‚Ä¶or create a new repository on the command¬†line

    echo "# the-meaning-of-life-is-42" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M master
    git remote add origin https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42.git
    git push -u origin master

### ‚Ä¶or push an existing repository from the command¬†line

    git remote add origin https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42.git
    git branch -M master
    git push -u origin master

### ‚Ä¶or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.

[Import code](https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42/import)

### 4. Whenever you clone a¬†repo:

#### It already has a¬†.git directory with certain configurations set up. To be able to push this repo to your newly created GitHub repo we have to change the remote¬†origin.

- To do that, just run this command: (Make sure you are inside the repo you cloned)

<!-- -->

    git remote set-url origin https://LINK/TO/YOUR/GIT/THAT/YOU/COPIED/FROM/PREVIOUS/STEP.git

OR:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HTnMuxJ4tCDJ3I49cUrP8w.png)

### 5. You can now run `git push` and it will push to your newly created¬†repo.

### Basic Git Work¬†Flow.

- After making changes to a file and you are ready to commit / push to your repo you can run the following commands:
- `git add .` ‚Äì stages modified files to be committed.
- `git status` ‚Äì displays files that have been modified
- `git commit -m 'A helpfully commit message'` ‚Äì commits the changes to your local repo. Get in the habit now of making helpful commit messages
- `git push` ‚Äì pushes your local commits to your GitHub repo!
- To pull down changes that your partner pushed to the repo you simply have to run:
- `git pull` ‚Äì this will fetch the most recent updates!

### Git basics

Like many disciplines, learning Git is just a matter of learning a new language. You‚Äôll cover a lot of new vocabulary in this lesson! Remember that the vocabulary you‚Äôll learn will allow you to communicate clearly with other developers worldwide, so it‚Äôs important to understand the meaning of each term.

It‚Äôs also important to note that Git is a complex and powerful tool. As such, its documentation and advanced examples may be tough to understand. As your knowledge grows, you may choose to dive deeper into Git. Today, you‚Äôll focus on the commands you‚Äôll use every day‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpossibly for the rest of your programming career! Get comfortable with these commands and resist the urge to copy/paste or create keyboard shortcuts as you‚Äôre getting started.

### A glance into¬†GIT

Before you look at any practical examples, let‚Äôs talk about how Git works behind the scenes.

Here is your first new word in Git-speak: _repository_, often shortened to _repo_. A Git repo comprises all the source code for a particular project. In the ‚Äúdark ages‚Äù example above, the repo is the first directory you created, where work is saved to, and which acts as the source for code shared to others. Without a repo, Git has nothing to act on.

Git manages your project as a series of _commits_. A commit is a collection of changes grouped towards a shared purpose. By tracking these commits, you can see your project on a timeline instead of only as a finished project:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Sc7e8RGGxhoCnMFG8KR6og.png)

Notice the notes and seemingly random numbers by each commit? These are referred to as _commit messages_ and _commit hashes_, respectively. Git identifies your commits by their hash, a specially-generated series of letters and numbers. You add commit messages to convey meaning and to help humans track your commits, as those hashes aren‚Äôt very friendly to read!

A Git hash is 40 characters long, but you only need the first few characters to identify which hash you‚Äôre referring to. By default, Git abbreviates hashes to 7 characters. You‚Äôll follow this convention, too.

Git provides a helpful way for us to ‚Äúalias‚Äù a commit in plain English as well. These aliases are called _refs_, short for ‚Äúreferences‚Äù. A special one that Git creates for all repositories is `HEAD`, which references the most recent commit. You‚Äôll learn more about creating your own refs when you learn about ‚Äúbranching‚Äù.

Git maintains three separate lists of changes: the _working directory_, the _staging area_, and the _commit history_. The working directory includes all of your in-progress changes, the staging area is reserved for changes you‚Äôre ready to commit, and the commit history is made up of changes you‚Äôve already committed. You‚Äôll look more at these three lists soon.

Git only cares about changes that are ‚Äútracked‚Äù. To track a file, you must add it to the commit history. The working directory will always show the changes, even if they aren‚Äôt tracked. In the commit history, you‚Äôll only have a history of files that have been formally tracked by your repository.

### Tracking changes in a repository

Now, let‚Äôs get practical!

You can create a repository with `git init`. Running this command will initialize a new Git repo in your current directory. It‚Äôs important to remember that you only want a repository for your project and not your whole hard drive, so always run this command inside a project folder and not your home folder or desktop. You can create a new repo in an empty folder or within a project directory you‚Äôve already created.

What good is an empty repo? Not much! To add content to your repository, use `git add`. You can pass this command a specific filename, a directory, a ‚Äúwildcard‚Äù to select a series of similarly-named files, or a¬†`.` to add every untracked file in the current directory:

    # This will add only my_app.js to the repo:

    > git add my_app.js

    # This will add all the files within ./objects:

    > git add objects/

    # This will add all the files in the current directory ending in `.js`:

    > git add *.js

    # This will add everything in your current directory:

    > git add .

Adding a file (or files) moves them from Git‚Äôs working directory to the staging area. You can see what‚Äôs been ‚Äústaged‚Äù and what hasn‚Äôt by using `git status`:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iiehU7FvC-JK90x6Fr0q6g.png)

In this example, ‚ÄúChanges to be committed‚Äù is your staging area and ‚ÄúChanges not staged for commit‚Äù is your working directory. Notice that you also have ‚ÄúUntracked files‚Äù, Git‚Äôs way of reminding us that you may have forgotten to `git add` a file to your repo. Most Git commands will include a bit of help text in the output, so always read the messages carefully before moving forward. Thanks, Git!

Once you‚Äôre happy with your files and have staged them, you‚Äôll use `git commit` to push them into the commit history. It‚Äôs significantly more work to make changes after a commit, so be sure your files are staged and exactly as you‚Äôd like them before running this command. Your default text editor will pop up, and you‚Äôll be asked to enter a commit message for this group of changes.

**Heads Up:** You may find yourself in an unfamiliar place! The default text editor for MacOS (and many variants of Linux) is called _Vim_. Vim is a terminal-based text editor you‚Äôll discuss in the near future. It‚Äôs visually bare and may just look like terminal text to you! If this happens, don‚Äôt worry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust type¬†`:q` and press your ‚Äúreturn‚Äù key to exit.

You‚Äôll want to ensure that future commit messages open in a more familiar editor. You can run the following commands in your terminal to ensure that Visual Studio Code is your `git commit` editor from now on:

    > git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

    > git config --global -e

If you experience any issues, you may be missing Visual Studio Code‚Äôs command line tools. You can find more details and some troubleshooting tips on Microsoft‚Äôs official [VS Code and macOS documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

Once you close your editor, the commit will be added to your repository‚Äôs commit history. Use `git log` to see this history at any time. This command will show all the commits in your repository‚Äôs history, beginning with the most recent:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z4zhzwjkwkfXMxKDDkNE9w.png)

Like many Git commands, `git commit` includes some helpful shorthand. If you need a rather short commit message, you can use the `-m` flag to include the message inline. Here‚Äôs an example:

    > git commit -m "Fix typo"

This will commit your changes with the message ‚ÄúFix typo‚Äù and avoid opening your default text editor. Remember the commit messages are how you make your project‚Äôs history friendly to humans, so don‚Äôt use the `-m` flag as an excuse to write lame commit messages! A commit message should always explain why changes were made in clear, concise language. It is also best practice to use imperative voice in commit messages (i.e. use ‚ÄúFix typo‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúFixing the typo‚Äù or ‚ÄúTypo was fixed‚Äù).

### Branches and¬†workflow

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7RBsBGvfmvj4T4jm.png)

You‚Äôve seen what a project looks like with a linear commit history, but that‚Äôs just scratching the surface of Git‚Äôs utility. Let‚Äôs explore a new realm with _branches_. A branch is a separate timeline in Git, reserved for its own changes. You‚Äôll use branches to make your own changes independently of others. These branches can then be _merged_ back into the main branch at a later time.

Let‚Äôs consider a common scenario: a school project. It‚Äôs a lot of extra hassle to schedule time together and argue over exactly what should be done next! Instead, group members will often assign tasks amongst themselves, work independently on their tasks, and reunite to bring it all together as a final report. Git branches let us emulate this workflow for code: you can make a copy of what‚Äôs been done so far, complete a task on your new branch, and merge that branch back into the shared repository for others to use.

By default, Git repos begin on the `master` branch. To create a new branch, use `git branch <name-of-your-branch>`. This will create a named reference to your current commit and let you add commits without affecting the `master` branch. Here‚Äôs what a branch looks like:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B67PLKs3Tr6HYLklyH6XnQ.png)

Notice how your refs help to identify branches here: `master` stays to itself and can have changes added to it independently of your new branch (`footer`). `HEAD`, Git‚Äôs special ref, follows us around, so you know that in the above diagram you‚Äôre working on the `footer` branch.

You can create a new branch or visit an existing branch in your repository. This is especially helpful for returning the `master` branch or for projects you‚Äôve received from teammates. To open an existing branch, use `git checkout <name-of-branch>`.

### Bringing it back¬†together

Once you‚Äôre happy with the code in the branch you‚Äôve been working on, you‚Äôll likely want to integrate the code into the `master` branch. You can do this via `git merge`. Merging will bring the changes in from another branch and integrate them into yours. Here‚Äôs an example workflow:

    > git branch my-changes

    > git add new-file.js

    > git commit -m "Add new file"

    > git checkout master

    > git merge my-changes

Following these steps will integrate the commit from `my-changes` over to `master`. Boom! Now you have your `new-file.js` on your default branch.

As you can imagine, branching can get _very_ complicated. Your repository‚Äôs history may look more like a shrub than a beautiful tree! You‚Äôll discuss advanced merging and other options in an upcoming lesson.

### Connect-W-Github

Git can act as a great history tool and source code backup for your local projects, but it can also help you work with a team! Git is classified as a ‚ÄúDVCS‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDistributed Version Control System‚Äù. This means it has built-in support for managing code both locally and from a distant source.

You can refer to a repository source that‚Äôs not local as a _remote_. Your Git repository can have any number of remotes, but you‚Äôll usually only have one. By default you‚Äôll refer to the primary remote of a repo as the `origin`.

You can add a remote to an existing repository on your computer, or you can retrieve a repository from a remote source. You can refer to this as _cloning_ the repo. Once you have a repository with a remote, you can update your local code from the remote by _pulling_ code down, and you can _push_ up your own code so others have access to it.

### I ‚ù§Ô∏è Open¬†Source

While a remote Git server can be run anywhere, there are a few places online that have become industry standards for hosting remote Git repositories. The best-known and most widely-used Git source is a website called [GitHub](https://github.com/). As the name suggests, GitHub is a global hub for Git repositories. It‚Äôs free to make a Github account, and you‚Äôll find literally millions of public repositories you can browse.

GitHub takes a lot of work out of managing remote Git repositories. Instead of having to manage your own server, GitHub provides managed hosting and even includes some helpful graphical tools for complicated tasks like deployment, branch merging, and code review.

Let‚Äôs look at a typical workflow using Git and GitHub. Imagine it‚Äôs your first day on the job. How do you get access to your team‚Äôs codebase? By cloning the repository!

    > git clone https://github.com/your-team/your-codebase.git

Using the `git clone` command will create a new folder in your current directory named after the repo you‚Äôre cloning (in this case, `your-codebase`). Inside that folder will be a git repository of your very own, containing the repo‚Äôs entire commit history.

You‚Äôll likely start on the `master` branch, but remember that this is the default branch and it‚Äôs unlikely you want to make changes to it. **_Since you‚Äôre working on a team now, it‚Äôs important to think of how your changes to the repository might affect others._**

The safest way to make changes is to create a new branch, make your changes there, and then push your branch up to the remote repository for review. You‚Äôll use the `git push` command to do this. Let‚Äôs look at an example:

    > git branch add-my-new-file

    > git add my-new-file.js

    > git commit -m "Add new file"

    > git push -u origin add-my-new-file

Notice how you used the `-u` flag with `git push`. This flag, shorthand for `--set-upstream`, lets Git know that you want your local branch to follow a remote branch. You‚Äôve passed the same name in, so you‚Äôll now have two branches in your local repository: `add-my-new-file`, which is where your changes live after being committed, and `origin/add-my-new-file`, which keeps up with your remote branch and updates it after you use `git push`.

**You only need to use the** `-u` **flag the first time you push each new branch ‚Äì Git will know what to do with a simple** `git push` **from then on.**

You now know how to push your changes up, but what about getting the changes your teammates have made? For this, you‚Äôll use `git pull`. Pulling from the remote repo will update all of your local branches with the code from each branch‚Äôs remote counterpart.

**Behind the scenes,** Git is running two separate commands: `git fetch` and `git merge`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Y6QQHsNKuayJ_WxQ)

Fetching retrieves the repository code and updates any remote tracking branches in your local repo, and merge does just you‚Äôve already explored: integrates changes into the local branches. Here‚Äôs a graphic to explain this a little better:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eJVpPtvfIeuYqmql0XkQ8Q.png)

It‚Äôs important to remember to use `git pull` often. A dynamic team may commit and push code many times during the day, and it‚Äôs easy to fall behind. The more often you `pull`, the more certain you can be that your own code is based on the ‚Äúlatest and greatest‚Äù.

### Merging your code on¬†GitHub

If you‚Äôre paying close attention, you may have noticed that there‚Äôs a missing step in your workflows so far: how do you get your code merged into your default branch? This is done by a process called a _Pull Request_.

A pull request (or ‚ÄúPR‚Äù) is a feature specific to GitHub, not a feature of Git. It‚Äôs a safety net to prevent bugs, and it‚Äôs a critical part of the collaboration workflow. Here‚Äôs a high-level of overview of how it works:

You push your code up to GitHub in its own branch.

You open a pull request against a _base branch_.

GitHub creates a comparison page just for your code, detailing the changes you‚Äôve made.

Other members of the team can review your code for errors.

You make changes to your branch based on feedback and push the new commits up.

The PR automatically updates with your changes.

Once everyone is satisfied, a repo maintainer on GitHub can merge your branch.

Huzzah! Your code is in the main branch and ready for everyone else to `git pull`.

You‚Äôll create and manage your pull requests via GitHub‚Äôs web portal, instead of the command line. You‚Äôll walk through the process of creating, reviewing, and merging a pull request in an upcoming project.

### Browsing Your Git Repository

Repositories can feel intimidating at first, but it won‚Äôt take you long to navigate code like you own the place‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause you do! Let‚Äôs discuss a few tools native to Git that help us browse our changes over time.

We‚Äôll be covering:

Comparing changes with `git diff`

Browsing through our code ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù with `git checkout`

### Seeing changes in real¬†time

Git is all about change tracking, so it makes sense that it would include a utility for visualizing a set of changes. We refer to a list of differences between two files (or the same file over time) as a _diff_, and we can use `git diff` to visualize diffs in our repo!

When run with no extra options, `git diff` will return any tracked changes in our working directory since the last commit. **Tracked** is a key word here; `git diff` won‚Äôt show us changes to files that haven‚Äôt been included in our repo via `git add`. This is helpful for seeing what you‚Äôve changed before committing! Here‚Äôs an example of a small change:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*zRnx1PxLRHNl9fYtBzxxsg.png)

Let‚Äôs break down some of the new syntax in this output.

The diff opens with some Git-specific data, including the branch/files we‚Äôre checking, and some unique hashes that Git uses to track each diff. You can skip past this to get to the important bits.

`---` & `+++` let us know that there are both additions and subtractions in the file ‚ÄúApp.js‚Äù. A diff doesn‚Äôt have a concept of inline changes ‚Äì it treats a single change as removing something old and replacing it with something new.

`@@` lets us know that we‚Äôre starting a single ‚Äúchunk‚Äù of the diff. A diff could have multiple chunks for a single file (for example: if you made changes far apart, like the header & footer). The numbers in between tell us how many lines we‚Äôre seeing and where they start. For example: `@@ +1,3 -1,3 @@` means we‚Äôll see three lines of significant content, including both addition & removal, beginning at line one.

In the code itself, lines that were removed are prefixed with a `-` and lines that were added are prefixed with a `+`. Remember that you won‚Äôt see these on the same lines. Even if you only changed a few words, Git will still treat it like the whole line was replaced.

### Diff options

Remember that, by default, `git diff` compares the current working directory to the last commit. You can compare the staging area instead of the working directory with `git diff --staged`. This is another great way to double-check your work before pushing up to a remote branch.

You‚Äôre also not limited to your current branch‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor even your current commit! You can pass a base & target branch to compare, and you can use some special characters to help you browse faster! Here are a few examples:

    # See differences between the 'feature'

    # branch and the 'master' branch.

    > git diff master feature

    # Compare two different commits

    > git diff 1fc345a 2e3dff

    # Compare a specific file across separate commits

    > git diff 1fc345a 2e3dff my-file.js

### Time travel

`git diff` gives us the opportunity to explore our code‚Äôs current state, but what if we wanted to see its state at a different point in time? We can use _checkout_! `git checkout` lets us take control of our `HEAD` to bounce around our timeline as we please.

Remember that `HEAD` is a special Git reference that usually follows the latest commit on our current branch. We can use `git checkout` to point our `HEAD` reference at a different commit, letting us travel to any commit in our repository‚Äôs history. By reading the commit message and exploring the code at the time of the commit, we can see not only what changed but also why it changed! This can be great for debugging a problem or understanding how an app evolved.

Let‚Äôs look at a diagram to understand what `checkout` does a little better:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eqVSR_YD0kYQWHoLLbJs9Q.png)

Notice that we haven‚Äôt lost any commits, commit messages, or code changes. Using `git checkout` is entirely non-destructive.

To browse to a different commit, simply pass in a reference or hash for the commit you‚Äôd like to explore. `git checkout` also supports a few special characters & reserved references:

    # You can checkout a branch name.

    # You'll be using this particular branch a lot!

    > git checkout master

    # You can also use commit hashes directly

    > git checkout 7d3e2f1

    # Using a hyphen instead of a hash will take

    # you to the last branch you checked out

    > git checkout -

    # You can use "HEAD~N" to move N commits prior

    # to the current HEAD

    > git checkout HEAD~3

Once you‚Äôre done browsing the repo‚Äôs history, you can use `git checkout <your-branch-name>` to move `HEAD` back to the front of the line (your most recent commit). For example, in our diagram above, we could use `git checkout master` to take our `HEAD` reference back to commit `42ffa1`.

### Why checkout?

Most of Git‚Äôs power comes from a simple ability: viewing commits in the past and understanding how they connect. This is why mastering the `git checkout` command is so important: it lets you think more like Git and gives you full freedom of navigation without risking damage to the repo‚Äôs contents.

That said, you‚Äôll likely use shortcuts like `git checkout -` far more often than specifically checking out commit hashes. Especially with the advent of user-friendly tools like GitHub, it‚Äôs much easier to visualize changes outside the command line. We‚Äôll demonstrate browsing commit histories on GitHub in a future lesson.

### Git ‚ÄòDo-Overs‚Äô: Reset &¬†Rebase

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5yBLWI2EMAqgm01n.jpg)

Git is designed to protect you‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot only from others, but also from yourself! Of course, there are times where you‚Äôd like to exercise your own judgement, even if it may not be the best thing to do. For this, Git provides some helpful tools to change commits and ‚Äútime travel‚Äù.

Before we talk about these, a warning: **The commands in this lesson are destructive!** If used improperly, you could lose work, damage a teammate‚Äôs branch, or even rewrite the history of your entire project. You should exercise caution when using these on production code, and don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help if you‚Äôre unsure what a command might do.

After this lesson, you should:

Be able to roll back changes to particular commit.

Have an understanding of how rebasing affects your commit history.

Know when to rebase/reset and when **not** to.

### Resetting the¬†past

Remember how our commits form a timeline? We can see the state of our project at any point using `git checkout`. What if we want to travel back in time to a point before we caused a new bug or chose a terrible font? `git reset` is the answer!

> _Resetting_ involves moving our `HEAD` ref back to a different commit.

No matter how we reset, `HEAD` will move with us. Unlike `git checkout`, this will also destroy intermediate commits. We can use some additional flags to determine how our code changes are handled.

### Soft resets

The least-dangerous reset of all is `git reset --soft`.

A soft reset will move our `HEAD` ref to the commit we‚Äôve specified, and will leave any intermediate changes in the staging area.

This means you won‚Äôt lose any code, though you will lose commit messages.

A practical example of when a soft reset would be handy is joining some small commits into a larger one. We‚Äôll pretend we‚Äôve been struggling with ‚Äútheir‚Äù, ‚Äúthere‚Äù, and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù in our app. Here‚Äôs our commit history:Those commit messages aren‚Äôt great: they‚Äôre not very explanatory, and they don‚Äôt provide a lot of value in our commit history. We‚Äôll fix them with a soft reset:

    git reset --soft 9c5e2fc

This moves our `HEAD` ref back to our first commit. Looking at our commit log now, we might be worried we‚Äôve lost our changes:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*slbLxXdNbv3L7UsCHGdCIg.png)

Our changes are still present in the staging area, ready to be re-committed when we‚Äôre ready! We can use `git commit` to re-apply those changes to our commit history with a new, more helpful message instead:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*UleGR-ijDRZw4UqbEbAk0Q.png)

Notice that the new commit has a totally new hash. The old commit messages (and their associated hashes) have been lost, but our code changes are safe and sound!

### Risky Business: Mixed¬†resets

If soft resets are the safest form of `git reset`, mixed resets are the most average! This is exactly why they‚Äôre the default: running `git reset` without adding a flag is the same as running `git reset --mixed`.

In a mixed reset, your changes are preserved, but they‚Äôre moved from the commit history directly to the working directory. This means you‚Äôll have to use `git add` to choose everything you want in future commits.

Mixed resets are a good option when you want to alter a change in a previous commit. Let‚Äôs use a mixed reset with our ‚Äútheir‚Äù, ‚Äúthere‚Äù, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù example again.

We‚Äôll start with ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*I71W4NpNdNz8NPr7i2tcAQ.png)

Notice again that you don‚Äôt lose your code with a mixed reset, but you do lose your commit messages & hashes. The difference between `--soft` and `--mixed` comes down to whether you‚Äôll be keeping the code exactly the same before re-committing it or making changes.

### Hard resets

Hard resets are the most dangerous type of reset in Git. Hard resets adjust your `HEAD` ref and _totally destroy any interim code changes_. Poof. Gone forever.

There are very few good uses for a hard reset, but one is to get yourself out of a tight spot. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve made a few changes to your repository but you now realize those changes were unnecessary. You‚Äôd like to move back in time so that your code looks exactly as it did before any changes were made. `git reset --hard` can take you there.

It‚Äôs our last round with ‚Äútheir‚Äù, ‚Äúthere‚Äù, and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù. We‚Äôve tried it all three ways and decided we don‚Äôt need to use that word at all! Let‚Äôs walk through a hard reset to get rid of our changes.

We‚Äôll start in the same place we began for our soft reset:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PHWuTBoZeQ1L2hgRdXu6fg.png)

It turns out that we‚Äôll be using a video on our homepage and don‚Äôt need text at all! Let‚Äôs step back in time:

    git reset --hard 9c5e2fc

Our Git log output is much simpler now:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1NovgUyM_ed7h5MozcBY-g.png)

It‚Äôs empty‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno changes in your working directory and no changes in your staging area. This is major difference between a hard reset and a soft/mixed reset: you will lose _all your changes_ back to the commit you‚Äôve reset to.

If your teammate came rushing in to tell you that the boss has changed their mind and wants that homepage text after all, you‚Äôre going to be re-doing all that work! Be very confident that the changes you‚Äôre losing are unimportant before embarking on a hard reset.

### Rebase: ‚ÄòAlt-time travel‚Äô

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*C_Y5Tr_o5BAS1l-3.jpeg)

Sometimes we want to change more than a few commits on a linear timeline. What if we want to move multiple commits across branches? `git rebase` is the tool for us!

_Rebasing_ involves changing your current branch‚Äôs base branch. We might do this if we accidentally started our branch from the wrong commit or if we‚Äôd like to incorporate changes from another branch into our own.

> Isn‚Äôt that the same as git merge?

`git merge`?‚Äù In almost all cases, you‚Äôd be right. Rebasing is a dangerous process that effectively rewrites history.

### I see you too like to live life Dangerously‚Ä¶ tell me about¬†Rebase..

Let‚Äôs look at a situation where we might be tempted to rebase. We‚Äôve added a couple commits to a feature branch while other team members have been merging their code into the `master` branch. Once we‚Äôre ready to merge our own branch, we probably want to follow a tried-and-true procedure:

    > git pull origin master

This will fetch our remote `master` branch and merge its changes into our own feature branch, so it‚Äôs safe to pull request or `git push`. However, every time we do that, a merge commit will be created! This can make a big mess of our Git commit history, especially if lots of people are making small changes.

We can use `git rebase` to move our changes silently onto the latest version of `master`. Here‚Äôs what the `git log` history of our two example branches looks like:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pzCQZEyJD3-NHcNRCTwxiQ.png)

Notice that both branches start at `9c5e2fc`. That‚Äôs our common ancestor commit, and is where `git merge` would start stitching these branches together! We‚Äôre going to avoid that entirely with a rebase. We‚Äôll run this command while we have `working-on-the-header` checked out:

    git rebase master

**Here‚Äôs our new commit history:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1cH8OazC0L0pxZzfCdwXog.png)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GswbfYSlQ3q0VeCdv29cww.png)

### `working-on-the-header`

See how we changed the color of our commits after the rebase? Take a close look at the commit history changes as well. Even though our commits have the same content, they have a new hash assigned, meaning they‚Äôre entirely new commits! This is what we mean by ‚Äúrewriting history‚Äù: we‚Äôve actually changed how Git refers to these changes now.

### ‚ÄúGolden Rule of¬†Git‚Äù

These tools can all feel pretty nifty, but be very wary of using them too much! While they can augment your Git skills from good to great, they can also have catastrophic side effects.

There‚Äôs a ‚ÄúGolden Rule of Git‚Äù you should know that directly relates to both `git reset` and `git rebase`:

**_Never change the history of a branch that‚Äôs shared with others._**

That‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs simple and to the point. If you‚Äôre resetting or rebasing your own code and you make a mistake, your worst case scenario is losing your own changes. However, if you start changing the history of code that others have contributed or are relying on, your accidental loss could affect many others!

The command below will add a file to the staging area. Just replace `filename_here` with the name of the file you want to add to the staging area.

    git add filename_here

### How to add all files in the staging area in¬†Git

If you want to add all files in your project to the staging area, you can use a wildcard¬†`.` and every file will be added for you.

    git add .

### How to add only certain files to the staging area in¬†Git

With the asterisk in the command below, you can add all files starting with ‚Äòfil‚Äô in the staging area.

    git add fil*

### How to check a repository‚Äôs status in¬†Git:

This command will show the status of the current repository including staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

    git status

### How to commit changes in the editor in¬†Git:

This command will open a text editor in the terminal where you can write a full commit message.

A commit message is made up of a short summary of changes, an empty line, and a full description of the changes after it.

    git commit

### How to commit changes with a message in¬†Git:

You can add a commit message without opening the editor. This command lets you only specify a short summary for your commit message.

    git commit -m "your commit message here"

### How to commit changes (and skip the staging area) in¬†Git:

You can add and commit tracked files with a single command by using the -a and -m options.

    git commit -a -m"your commit message here"

### How to see your commit history in¬†Git:

This command shows the commit history for the current repository:

    git log

### How to see your commit history including changes in¬†Git:

This command shows the commit‚Äôs history including all files and their changes:

    git reset HEAD filename
    git reset HEAD -p

### How to amend the most recent commit in¬†Git:

`git commit --amend` allows you to modify and add changes to the most recent commit.

    git commit --amend

!!Note!!: fixing up a local commit with amend is great and you can push it to a shared repository after you‚Äôve fixed it. But you should avoid amending commits that have already been made public.

### How to rollback the last commit in¬†Git:

`git revert` will create a new commit that is the opposite of everything in the given commit.  
We can revert the latest commit by using the head alias like this:

    git revert HEAD

### How to rollback an old commit in¬†Git:

You can revert an old commit using its commit id. This opens the editor so you can add a commit message.

    git revert comit_id_here

### How to create a new branch in¬†Git:

By default, you have one branch, the main branch. With this command, you can create a new branch. Git won‚Äôt switch to it automatically‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou will need to do it manually with the next command.

    git branch branch_name

### How to switch to a newly created branch in¬†Git:

When you want to use a different or a newly created branch you can use this command:

    git checkout branch_name

### How to list branches in¬†Git:

You can view all created branches using the `git branch` command. It will show a list of all branches and mark the current branch with an asterisk and highlight it in green.

    git branch

### How to create a branch in Git and switch to it immediately:

In a single command, you can create and switch to a new branch right away.

    git checkout -b branch_name

### How to delete a branch in¬†Git:

When you are done working with a branch and have merged it, you can delete it using the command below:

    git branch -d branch_name

### How to merge two branches in¬†Git:

To merge the history of the branch you are currently in with the `branch_name`, you will need to use the command below:

    git merge branch_name

### How to show the commit log as a graph in¬†Git:

We can use `--graph` to get the commit log to show as a graph. Also,  
`--oneline` will limit commit messages to a single line.

    git log --graph --oneline

### How to show the commit log as a graph of all branches in¬†Git:

Does the same as the command above, but for all branches.

    git log --graph --online --all

### How to abort a conflicting merge in¬†Git:

If you want to throw a merge away and start over, you can run the following command:

    git merge --abort

### How to add a remote repository in¬†Git

This command adds a remote repository to your local repository (just replace `https://repo_here` with your remote repo URL).

    git add remote https://repo_here

### How to see remote URLs in¬†Git:

You can see all remote repositories for your local repository with this command:

    git remote -v

### How to get more info about a remote repo in¬†Git:

Just replace `origin` with the name of the remote obtained by  
running the git remote -v command.

    git remote show origin

### How to push changes to a remote repo in¬†Git:

When all your work is ready to be saved on a remote repository, you can push all changes using the command below:

    git push

### How to pull changes from a remote repo in¬†Git:

If other team members are working on your repository, you can retrieve the latest changes made to the remote repository with the command below:

    git pull

### How to check remote branches that Git is tracking:

This command shows the name of all remote branches that Git is tracking for the current repository:

    git branch -r

### How to fetch remote repo changes in¬†Git:

This command will download the changes from a remote repo but will not perform a merge on your local branch (as git pull does that instead).

    git fetch

### How to check the current commits log of a remote repo in¬†Git

Commit after commit, Git builds up a log. You can find out the remote repository log by using this command:

    git log origin/main

### How to merge a remote repo with your local repo in¬†Git:

If the remote repository has changes you want to merge with your local, then this command will do that for you:

    git merge origin/main

### How to get the contents of remote branches in Git without automatically merging:

This lets you update the remote without merging any content into the  
local branches. You can call git merge or git checkout to do the merge.

    git remote update

### How to push a new branch to a remote repo in¬†Git:

If you want to push a branch to a remote repository you can use the command below. Just remember to add -u to create the branch upstream:

    git push -u origin branch_name

### How to remove a remote branch in¬†Git:

If you no longer need a remote branch you can remove it using the command below:

    git push --delete origin branch_name_here

### How to use Git¬†rebase:

You can transfer completed work from one branch to another using `git rebase`.

    git rebase branch_name_here

Git Rebase can get really messy if you don‚Äôt do it properly. Before using this command I suggest that you re-read the official documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

### How to run rebase interactively in¬†Git:

You can run git rebase interactively using the -i flag.  
It will open the editor and present a set of commands you can use.

    git rebase -i master
    # p, pick = use commit
    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
    # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
    # f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
    # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
    # d, drop = remove commit

### How to force a push request in¬†Git:

This command will force a push request. This is usually fine for pull request branches because nobody else should have cloned them.  
But this isn‚Äôt something that you want to do with public repos.

    git push -f

### Git Alias¬†Overview

It is important to note that there is no direct `git alias` command. Aliases are created through the use of the `git config` command and the Git configuration files. As with other configuration values, aliases can be created in a local or global scope.

To better understand Git aliases let us create some examples.

    $ git config --global alias.co checkout
    $ git config --global alias.br branch
    $ git config --global alias.ci commit
    $ git config --global alias.st status

The previous code example creates globally stored shortcuts for common git commands. Creating the aliases will not modify the source commands. So `git checkout` will still be available even though we now have the `git co` alias. These aliases were created with the `--global` flag which means they will be stored in Git‚Äôs global operating system level configuration file. On linux systems, the global config file is located in the User home directory at `/.gitconfig`.

    [alias]
            co = checkout
                br = branch
                ci = commit
                st = status

This demonstrates that the aliases are now equivalent to the source commands.

### Usage

Git aliasing is enabled through the use of `git config`, For command-line option and usage examples please review the `git config `documentation.

### Examples

### Using aliases to create new Git¬†commands

A common Git pattern is to remove recently added files from the staging area. This is achieved by leveraging options to the `git reset` command. A new alias can be created to encapsulate this behavior and create a new alias-command-keyword which is easy to remember:

    git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'

The preceding code example creates a new alias `unstage`. This now enables the invocation of `git unstage. git unstage` which will perform a reset on the staging area. This makes the following two commands equivalent.

    git unstage fileA
    $ git reset HEAD -- fileA

### Troubleshooting Git

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cFb6UcCGmIcNU1-woncSTA.png)

### Here are some tips on troubleshooting and resolving issues with¬†Git.

### Broken pipe errors on `git push`

‚ÄòBroken pipe‚Äô errors can occur when attempting to push to a remote repository. When pushing you usually see:

    Write failed: Broken pipe
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

To fix this issue, here are some possible solutions.

### Increase the POST buffer size in¬†Git

**If you‚Äôre using Git over HTTP instead of SSH**, you can try increasing the POST buffer size in Git‚Äôs configuration.

Example of an error during a clone: `fatal: pack has bad object at offset XXXXXXXXX: inflate returned -5`

Open a terminal and enter:

    git config http.postBuffer 52428800

The value is specified in bytes, so in the above case the buffer size has been set to 50MB. The default is 1MB.

### Check your SSH configuration

**If pushing over SSH**, first check your SSH configuration as ‚ÄòBroken pipe‚Äô errors can sometimes be caused by underlying issues with SSH (such as authentication). Make sure that SSH is correctly configured by following the instructions in the [SSH troubleshooting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#troubleshooting-ssh-connections) documentation.

If you‚Äôre a GitLab administrator and have access to the server, you can also prevent session timeouts by configuring SSH `keep alive` either on the client or on the server.

Configuring both the client and the server is unnecessary.

**To configure SSH on the client side**:

- On UNIX, edit `~/.ssh/config` (create the file if it doesn‚Äôt exist) and add or edit:
- `Host your-gitlab-instance-url.com ServerAliveInterval 60 ServerAliveCountMax 5`
- On Windows, if you are using PuTTY, go to your session properties, then navigate to ‚ÄúConnection‚Äù and under ‚ÄúSending of null packets to keep session active‚Äù, set `Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off)` to `60`.

**To configure SSH on the server side**, edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and add:

    ClientAliveInterval 60
    ClientAliveCountMax 5

### Running a `git repack`

**If ‚Äòpack-objects‚Äô type errors are also being displayed**, you can try to run a `git repack` before attempting to push to the remote repository again:

    git repack
    git push

### Upgrade your Git¬†client

In case you‚Äôre running an older version of Git (&lt; 2.9), consider upgrading to &gt;= 2.9 (see [Broken pipe when pushing to Git repository](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19120120/broken-pipe-when-pushing-to-git-repository/36971469#36971469)).

### `ssh_exchange_identification` error

Users may experience the following error when attempting to push or pull using Git over SSH:

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    ...
    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

or

    ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

This error usually indicates that SSH daemon‚Äôs `MaxStartups` value is throttling SSH connections. This setting specifies the maximum number of concurrent, unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon. This affects users with proper authentication credentials (SSH keys) because every connection is ‚Äòunauthenticated‚Äô in the beginning. The default value is `10`.

Increase `MaxStartups` on the GitLab server by adding or modifying the value in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

    MaxStartups 100:30:200

`100:30:200` means up to 100 SSH sessions are allowed without restriction, after which 30% of connections are dropped until reaching an absolute maximum of 200.

Once configured, restart the SSH daemon for the change to take effect.

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo systemctl restart ssh

    # CentOS/RHEL
    sudo service sshd restart

### Timeout during `git push` / `git pull`

If pulling/pushing from/to your repository ends up taking more than 50 seconds, a timeout is issued. It contains a log of the number of operations performed and their respective timings, like the example below:

    remote: Running checks for branch: master
    remote: Scanning for LFS objects... (153ms)
    remote: Calculating new repository size... (cancelled after 729ms)

This could be used to further investigate what operation is performing poorly and provide GitLab with more information on how to improve the service.

### `git clone` over HTTP fails with `transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining` error

If the buffer size is lower than what is allowed in the request, the action fails with an error similar to the one below:

    error: RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    fatal: early EOF
    fatal: index-pack failed

This can be fixed by increasing the existing `http.postBuffer` value to one greater than the repository size. For example, if `git clone` fails when cloning a 500M repository, you should set `http.postBuffer` to `524288000`. That setting ensures the request only starts buffering after the first 524288000 bytes.

The default value of `http.postBuffer`, 1 MiB, is applied if the setting is not configured.

    git config http.postBuffer 524288000

### How to learn effectively

**Learning**: The acquisition of skills and the ability to apply them in the future.

**What makes an Effective learner?**

- They are active listeners.
- They are engaged with the material.
- They are receptive of feedback.
- They are open to difficulty.

**Why do active learning techniques feel difficult?**

- It feels difficult because you are constantly receiving feedback, and so you are constantly adapting and perfecting the material.

**Desirable Difficulty**

- The skills we wish to obtain is often a difficult one.
- We want challenging but possible lessons based on current level of skill.

**Effective learners space their practice**

- Consistent effort &gt; cramming =&gt; for **durable knowledge**

### Getting visual feedback in your¬†programs

The first command we‚Äôll learn in JavaScript is `console.log`. This command is used to _print_ something onto the screen. As we write our first lines of code, we‚Äôll be using `console.log` frequently as a way to visually see the output of our programs. Let‚Äôs write our first program:

    console.log("hello world");
    console.log("how are you?");

Executing the program above would print out the following:

    hello world
    how are you?

Nothing too ground breaking here, but pay close attention to the exact way we wrote the program. In particular, notice how we lay out the periods, parentheses, and quotation marks. We‚Äôll also terminate lines with semicolons (;).

> _Depending on how you structure your code, sometimes you‚Äôll be able to omit semicolons at the end of lines. For now, you‚Äôll want to include them just as we do._

### Syntax

We refer to the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords as **syntax**. These details matter‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour computer will only be able to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù proper JavaScript syntax. A programming language is similar to a spoken language. A spoken language like English has grammar rules that we should follow in order to be understood by fellow speakers. In the same way, a programming language like JavaScript has syntax rules that we ought to follow!

As you write your first lines of code in this new language, you may make many syntax errors. Don‚Äôt get frustrated! This is normal‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall new programmers go through this phase. Every time we recognize an error in our code, we have an opportunity to reinforce your understanding of correct syntax. Adopt a growth mindset and learn from your mistakes.

Additionally, one of the best things about programming is that we can get such immediate feedback from our creations. There is no penalty for making a mistake when programming. Write some code, run the code, read the errors, fix the errors, rinse and repeat!

### Code comments

Occasionally we‚Äôll want to leave **comments** or notes in our code. Commented lines will be ignored by our computer. This means that we can use comments to write plain english or temporarily avoid execution of some JavaScript lines. The proper _syntax_ for writing a comment is to begin the line with double forward slashes (`//`):

    // let's write another program!!!
    console.log("hello world");

    // console.log("how are you?");

    console.log("goodbye moon");

The program above would only print:

    hello world
    goodbye moon

Comments are useful when annotating pieces of code to offer an explanation of how the code works. We‚Äôll want to strive to write straightforward code that is self-explanatory when possible, but we can also use comments to add additional clarity. The real art of programming is to write code so elegantly that it is easy to follow.

**The Number Data Type**

The **number** data type in JS is used to represent any numerical values, including integers and decimal numbers.

**Basic Arithmetic Operators**

Operators are the symbols that perform particular operations.

- **+** (addition)
- **‚Äì** (subtraction)
- **asterisk** (multiplication)
- **/** (division)
- **%** (modulo)

JS evaluates more complex expressions using the general math order of operations aka PEMDAS.

- **PEMDAS**¬†: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Addition, Subtraction.
- _To force a specific order of operation, use the group operator ( ) around a part of the expression._

**Modulo**¬†: Very useful operation to check divisibility of numbers, check for even & odd, whether a number is prime, and much more! _(Discrete Math concept, circular problems can be solved with modulo)_

- Whenever you have a smaller number % a larger number, the answer will just be the initial small number.¬†  
  ¬†console.log(7 % 10) // =&gt; 7;

**The String Data Type**

The **string** data type is a primitive data type that used to represent textual data.

- can be wrapped by either **single** or **double** quotation marks, _best to choose one and stick with it for consistency_.
- If your string contains quotation marks inside, can layer single or double quotation marks to allow it to work.  
  ¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great string‚Äù; (valid)
    
  ¬†‚ÄòShakespeare wrote, ‚ÄúTo be or not to be‚Äù‚Äô; (valid)
    
  ¬†‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a bad string‚Äô; (invalid)
- Alt. way to add other quotes within strings is to use template literals.  
  ¬†\`This is a temp‚Äôl‚Äôate literal ${function}\` // use ${} to invoke functions within.
- **.length**¬†: property that can be appended to data to return the length.
- empty strings have a length of zero.
- **indices**¬†: indexes of data that begin at 0, can call upon index by using the bracket notation \[ \].  
  ¬†console.log(‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù\[0\]); // =&gt; ‚Äúb‚Äù  
  ¬†console.log(‚Äúbootcamp‚Äù\[10\]); // =&gt; ‚Äúundefined‚Äù  
  ¬†console.log(‚Äúboots‚Äù\[1 \* 2\]); // =&gt; ‚Äúo‚Äù  
  ¬†console.log(‚Äúboots‚Äù\[‚Äúboot‚Äù.length-1\]); // =&gt; ‚Äút‚Äù
- we can pass expressions through the brackets as well since JS always evaluates expressions first.
- The index of the last character of a string is always one less than it‚Äôs length.
- **indexOf()**¬†: method used to find the first index of a given character within a string.  
  ¬†console.log(‚Äúbagel‚Äù.indexOf(‚Äúb‚Äù)); // =&gt; 0  
  ¬†console.log(‚Äúbagel‚Äù.indexOf(‚Äúz‚Äù)); // =&gt; -1
- if the character inside the indexOf() search does not exist in the string, the output will be -1.
- the indexOf() search will return the first instanced index of the the char in the string.
- **concatenate**¬†: word to describe joining strings together into a single string.

**The Boolean Data Type**

The **Boolean** data type is the simplest data type since there are only two values: **true** and **false**.

- **Logical Operators** (B*oolean Operators*) are used to establish logic in our code.
- **!** (not)¬†: reverses a Boolean value.  
  ¬†console.log(!true); // =&gt; false  
  ¬†console.log(!!false); // =&gt; false
- **Logical Order of Operations**¬†: JS will evaluate¬†!, then &&, then ||.
- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**¬†: Because JS evalutes from left to right, expressions can ‚Äúshort-circuit‚Äù. For example if we have true on the left of an || logical comparison, it will stop evaluating and yield true instead of wasting resources on processing the rest of the statement.  
  ¬†console.log(true ||¬†!false) // =&gt; stops after it sees ‚Äútrue ||‚Äù

**Comparison Operators**

All comparison operators will result in a boolean output.

**The relative comparators**

- **&gt;** (greater than)
- **&lt;** (less than)
- **&gt;=** (greater than or equal to)
- **&lt;=** (less than or equal to)
- **===** (equal to)
- **!==** (not equal to)

Fun Fact: ‚Äúa‚Äù &lt; ‚Äúb‚Äù is considered valid JS Code because string comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order), so ‚Äúa‚Äù is less than ‚Äúb‚Äù because it appears earlier!

If there is ever a standstill comparison of two string lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the shorter string lesser.

**Difference between == and ===**

#### ===

Strict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.

#### ==

Loose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)

**Variables**

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.

- We initialize a variable by using the **let** keyword and a **=** single equals sign (assignment operator).¬†  
  ¬†let bootcamp = ‚ÄúApp Academy‚Äù;  
  ¬†console.log(bootcamp); // ‚ÄúApp Academy‚Äù
- JS variable names can contain any alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dollar signs (cannot being with a number).
- If you do not declare a value for a variable, undefined is automatically set.¬†  
  ¬†let bootcamp;  
  ¬†console.log(bootcamp); // undefined
- We can change the value of a previously declared variable (let, not const) by re-assigning it another value.
- **let** is the updated version of **var**; there are some differences in terms of hoisting and global/block scope

**Assignment Shorthand**

let num = 0;  
¬†num += 10; // same as num = num + 10  
¬†num -= 2; // same as num = num‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää2  
¬†num /= 4; // same as num = num / 4  
¬†num \*= 7; // same as num = num \* 7

- In general, any nonsensical arithmetic will result in **NaN**¬†; usually operations that include undefined.

**Functions**

A function is a procedure of code that will run when called. Functions are used so that we do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing over and over. (Think of them as ‚Äòsubprograms‚Äô)

- **Function Declaration**¬†: Process when we first initially write our function.
- Includes three things:
- Name of the function.
- A list of _parameters_ ()
- The code to execute {}
- **Function Calls**¬†: We can call upon our function whenever and wherever\* we want. (\*wherever is only after the initial declaration)
- JS evaluates code top down, left to right.
- When we execute a declared function later on in our program we refer to this as **invoking** our function.
- Every function in JS returns undefined unless otherwise specified.
- When we hit a **return** statement in a function we immediately exit the function and return to where we called the function.
- When naming functions in JS always use camelCase and name it something appropriate.

Greate code reads like English and almost explains itself. Think: Elegant, readable, and maintainable!

**Parameters and Arguments**

- **Parameters**¬†: Comma seperated variables specified as part of a function‚Äôs declaration.
- **Arguments**¬†: Values passed to the function when it is invoked.
- _If the number of arguments passed during a function invocation is different than the number of paramters listed, it will still work._
- However, is there are not enough arguments provided for parameters our function will likely yield **Nan**.

### Including Comments

Comments are important because they help other people understand what is going on in your code or remind you if you forgot something yourself. Keep in mind that they have to be marked properly so the browser won‚Äôt try to execute them.

In JavaScript you have two different options:

- Single-line comments‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTo include a comment that is limited to a single line, precede it with `//`
- Multi-line comments‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIn case you want to write longer comments between several lines, wrap it in `/*` and `*/` to avoid it from being executed

### Variables in JavaScript

Variables are stand-in values that you can use to perform operations. You should be familiar with them from math class.

### var, const,¬†let

You have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in JavaScript, each with their own specialties:

- `var`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with `var` move to the top when the code is executed.
- `const`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCan not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.
- `let`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSimilar to `const`, the `let` variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

### Data Types

Variables can contain different types of values and data types. You use `=` to assign them:

- Numbers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`var age = 23`
- Variables‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`var x`
- Text (strings)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`var a = "init"`
- Operations‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`var b = 1 + 2 + 3`
- True or false statements‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`var c = true`
- Constant numbers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`const PI = 3.14`
- Objects‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}`

There are more possibilities. Note that variables are case sensitive. That means `lastname` and `lastName` will be handled as two different variables.

### Objects

Objects are certain kinds of variables. They are variables that can have their own values and methods. The latter are actions that you can perform on objects.

var person = {

firstName:‚ÄùJohn‚Äù,

lastName:‚ÄùDoe‚Äù,

age:20,

nationality:‚ÄùGerman‚Äù

};

### The Next Level:¬†Arrays

Next up in our JavaScript cheat sheet are arrays. Arrays are part of many different programming languages. They are a way of organizing variables and properties into groups. Here‚Äôs how to create one in JavaScript:

var fruit = \[‚ÄúBanana‚Äù, ‚ÄúApple‚Äù, ‚ÄúPear‚Äù\];

Now you have an array called `fruit` which contains three items that you can use for future operations.

### Array Methods

Once you have created arrays, there are a few things you can do with them:

- `concat()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäJoin several arrays into one
- `indexOf()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReturns the first position at which a given element appears in an array
- `join()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCombine elements of an array into a single string and return the string
- `lastIndexOf()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGives the last position at which a given element appears in an array
- `pop()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRemoves the last element of an array
- `push()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAdd a new element at the end
- `reverse()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSort elements in a descending order
- `shift()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRemove the first element of an array
- `slice()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPulls a copy of a portion of an array into a new array
- `sort()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSorts elements alphabetically
- `splice()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAdds elements in a specified way and position
- `toString()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäConverts elements to strings
- `unshift()` ‚ÄîAdds a new element to the beginning
- `valueOf()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReturns the primitive value of the specified object

### Operators

If you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations. To do so, you need operators.

### Basic Operators

- `+`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAddition
- `-`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSubtraction
- `*`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMultiplication
- `/`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDivision
- `(...)`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGrouping operator, operations within brackets are executed earlier than those outside
- `%`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäModulus (remainder )
- `++`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIncrement numbers
- `--`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDecrement numbers

### Comparison Operators

- `==`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEqual to
- `===`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEqual value and equal type
- `!=`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNot equal
- `!==`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNot equal value or not equal type
- `>`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGreater than
- `<`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLess than
- `>=`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGreater than or equal to
- `<=`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLess than or equal to
- `?`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTernary operator

### Logical Operators

- `&&`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLogical and
- `||`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLogical or
- `!`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLogical not

### Bitwise Operators

- `&`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAND statement
- `|`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOR statement
- `~`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNOT
- `^`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäXOR
- `<<`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLeft shift
- `>>`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRight shift
- `>>>`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäZero fill right shift

### Functions

JavaScript functions are blocks of code that perform a certain task. A basic function looks like this:

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {

// what the function does

}

As you can see, it consists of the `function` keyword plus a name. The function‚Äôs parameters are in the brackets and you have curly brackets around what the function performs. You can create your own, but to make your life easier ‚Äì there are also a number of default functions.

### Outputting Data

A common application for functions is the output of data. For the output, you have the following options:

- `alert()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOutput data in an alert box in the browser window
- `confirm()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOpens up a yes/no dialog and returns true/false depending on user click
- `console.log()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWrites information to the browser console, good for debugging purposes
- `document.write()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWrite directly to the HTML document
- `prompt()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCreates a dialogue for user input

### Global Functions

Global functions are functions built into every browser capable of running JavaScript.

- `decodeURI()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDecodes a [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) created by `encodeURI` or similar
- `decodeURIComponent()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDecodes a URI component
- `encodeURI()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEncodes a URI into UTF-8
- `encodeURIComponent()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSame but for URI components
- `eval()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEvaluates JavaScript code represented as a string
- `isFinite()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDetermines whether a passed value is a finite number
- `isNaN()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDetermines whether a value is NaN or not
- `Number()` ‚Äî- Returns a number converted from its argument
- `parseFloat()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäParses an argument and returns a floating-point number
- `parseInt()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäParses its argument and returns an integer

### JavaScript Loops

Loops are part of most programming languages. They allow you to execute blocks of code desired number of times with different values:

for (before loop; condition **for** loop; execute after loop) {

// what to do during the loop

}

You have several parameters to create loops:

- `for`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe most common way to create a loop in JavaScript
- `while`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSets up conditions under which a loop executes
- `do while`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSimilar to the `while` loop but it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again
- `break` ‚ÄîUsed to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions
- `continue`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSkip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met

### If‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäElse Statements

These types of statements are easy to understand. Using them, you can set conditions for when your code is executed. If certain conditions apply, something is done, if not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomething else is executed.

if (condition) {

// what to do if condition is met

} **else** {

// what to do if condition is not met

}

A similar concept to `if else` is the `switch` statement. However, using the switch you select one of several code blocks to execute.

### Strings

Strings are what JavaScript calls to text that does not perform a function but can appear on the screen.

var person = ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù;

In this case, `John Doe` is the string.

### Escape Characters

In JavaScript, strings are marked with single or double-quotes. If you want to use quotation marks in a string, you need to use special characters:

- `\'`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSingle quote
- `\"`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDouble quote

Aside from that you also have additional escape characters:

- `\\`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBackslash
- `\b`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBackspace
- `\f`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäForm feed
- `\n`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNew line
- `\r`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCarriage return
- `\t`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHorizontal tabulator
- `\v`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäVertical tabulator

### String Methods

There are many different ways to work with strings:

- `charAt()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReturns a character at a specified position inside a string
- `charCodeAt()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäGives you the Unicode of a character at that position
- `concat()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäConcatenates (joins) two or more strings into one
- `fromCharCode()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReturns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units
- `indexOf()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäProvides the position of the first occurrence of a specified text within a string
- `lastIndexOf()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSame as `indexOf()` but with the last occurrence, searching backward
- `match()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRetrieves the matches of a string against a search pattern
- `replace()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFind and replace specified text in a string
- `search()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäExecutes a search for a matching text and returns its position
- `slice()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäExtracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string
- `split()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSplits a string object into an array of strings at a specified position
- `substr()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSimilar to `slice()` but extracts a substring depending on a specified number of characters
- `substring()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAlso similar to `slice()` but can‚Äôt accept negative indices
- `toLowerCase()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäConvert strings to lower case
- `toUpperCase()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäConvert strings to upper case
- `valueOf()`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReturns the primitive value (that has no properties or methods) of a string object

### Regular Expression Syntax

Regular expressions are search patterns used to match character combinations in strings. The search pattern can be used for text search and text to replace operations.

### Pattern Modifiers

- `e`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEvaluate replacement
- `i`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPerform case-insensitive matching
- `g`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPerform global matching
- `m`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPerform multiple line matching
- `s`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTreat strings as a single line
- `x`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAllow comments and whitespace in the pattern
- `U`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäUngreedy pattern

### Brackets

- `[abc]`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFind any of the characters between the brackets
- `[^abc]`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFind any character which is not in the brackets
- `[0-9]`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäUsed to find any digit from 0 to 9
- `[A-z]`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFind any character from uppercase A to lowercase z
- `(a|b|c)`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFind any of the alternatives separated with `|`

### Dealing with Dates in JavaScript

You can also work with and modify dates and time with JavaScript. This is the next chapter in the JavaScript cheat sheet.

### Setting Dates

- `Date(2017, 5, 21, 3, 23, 10, 0)`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCreate a custom date object. The numbers represent a year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, milliseconds. You can omit anything you want except for a year and month.
- `Date("2017-06-23")`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDate declaration as a string

### Pulling Date and Time¬†Values

### Error Name¬†Values

JavaScript also has a built-in error object. It has two properties:

- `name`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSets or returns the error name
- `message`‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSets or returns an error message in a string from

The error property can return six different values as its name:

### Explicit Conversions

The simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the `Boolean(), Number()`, and `String()` functions.

Any value other than `null `or `undefined `has a` toString()` method.

`n.toString(2);`

binary

`n.toString(8);`

octal

`n.toString(16);`

hex

`let n = 123456.789;`

`n.toFixed(0)`

‚Äú123457‚Äù

`n.toFixed(5)`

‚Äú123456.78900‚Äù

`n.toExponential(3)`

‚Äú1.235e+5‚Äù

`n.toPrecision(7)`

‚Äú123456.8‚Äù

`n.toPrecision(10)`

‚Äú123456.7890‚Äù

`parseInt("3 blind mice")`

`parseFloat(" 3.14 meters")`

3.14

`parseInt("-12.34")`

-12

`parseInt("0xFF")`

### Conversion Idioms

`x + ""`

`String(x)`

`+x`

`Number(x)`

`x-0`

`Number(x)`

`!!x`

`Boolean(x)`

### Destructuring Assignment

`let [x,y] = [1,2];`

let x=1, y=2

`[x,y] = [x + 1,y + 1];`

x = x + 1, y = y + 1

`[x,y] = [y,x];`

Swap the value of the two variables

Destructuring assignment makes it easy to work with functions that return arrays of values:

`let [r,theta] = toPolar(1.0, 1.0);`

    function toPolar(x, y) {

    return [Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y), Math.atan2(y,x)];

    }

Variable destructuring in loops:

`let o = { x: 1, y: 2 };`

    for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(o)) {

    console.log(name, value); // Prints "x 1" and "y 2"

    }

**Note**: The `Object.entries()` method returns an array of a given object‚Äôs own enumerable string-keyed property `[key, value]` pairs, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop. (The only important difference is that a `for...in` loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well).

The list of variables on the left can include extra commas to skip certain values on the right

`[,x,,y] = [1,2,3,4];`

x == 2; y == 4

**Note**: the last comma does not stand for a value.

To collect all unused or remaining values into a single variable when destructuring an array, use three dots `(...) `before the last variable name on the left-hand side

`let [x, ...y] = [1,2,3,4];`

y == \[2,3,4\]

`let [first, ...rest] = "Hello";`

first == ‚ÄúH‚Äù; rest ==\[‚Äúe‚Äù,‚Äùl‚Äù,‚Äùl‚Äù,‚Äùo‚Äù\]

Destructuring assignment can also be performed when the righthand side is an object value.

`let transparent = {r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0};`

`let {r, g, b} = transparent;`

r == 0.0; g == 0.0; b == 0.0

`const {sin, cos, tan} = Math;`

sin=Math.sin, cos=Math.cos, tan=Math.tan

### Expressions and Operators

In JavaScript, the values `null `and `undefined `are the only two values that do not have properties. In a regular property access expression using¬†. or \[\], you get a `TypeError` if the expression on the left evaluates to `null `or `undefined`. You can use¬†`?.` and¬†`?.[]` syntax to guard against errors of this type.

You can also invoke a function using¬†`?.()` instead of `()`.

With the `new ?.()` invocation syntax, if the expression to the left of the¬†`?.` evaluates to `null` or `undefined`, then the entire invocation expression evaluates to `undefined `and no exception is thrown.

Write the function invocation using¬†`?.(),` knowing that invocation will only happen if there is actually a value to be invoked

    function square(x, log) {

    log?.(x); // Call the function if there is one

    return x * x;

    }

Note that expression `x++` is not always the same as `x = x + 1`.The `++` operator never performs string concatenation: it always converts its operand to a number and increments it. If x is the string ‚Äú1‚Äù, `++x` is the number 2, but` x + 1` is the string ‚Äú11‚Äù.

JavaScript objects are compared by reference, not by value. An object is equal to itself, but not to any other object. If two distinct objects have the same number of properties, with the same names and values, they are still not equal. Similarly, two arrays that have the same elements in the same order are not equal to each other.

`NaN `value is never equal to any other value, including itself! To check whether a value `x` is `NaN`, use `x !== `, or the global `isNaN()` function.

If both values refer to the same object, array, or function, they are equal. If they refer to different objects, they are not equal, even if both objects have identical properties.

### Evaluating Expressions

JavaScript has the ability to interpret strings of JavaScript source code, evaluating them to produce a value.

`eval("3+2")`

Because of security issues, some web servers use the HTTP ‚ÄúContent-Security-Policy‚Äù header to disable` eval()` for an entire website.

### First-Defined (??)

The first-defined operator¬†`??` evaluates to its first defined operand: if its left operand is not `null` and not `undefined`, it returns that value.

`a ?? b` is equivalent to `(a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b`

`??` is a useful alternative to `||.` The problem with this idiomatic use is that zero, the empty string, and false are all `falsy `values that may be perfectly valid in some circumstances. In this code example, if `maxWidth `is zero, that value will be ignored. But if we change the `||` operator to¬†`??`, we end up with an expression where zero is a valid value.

`let max = maxWidth || preferences.maxWidth || 500;`

`let max = maxWidth ?? preferences.maxWidth ?? 500;`

### delete Operator

Deleting an array element leaves a ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the array and does not change the array‚Äôs length. The resulting array is sparse.

### void Operator

Using the `void` operator makes sense only if the operand has side effects.

`let counter = 0;`

`const increment = () => void counter++;`

`increment()`

undefined

`counter`

1

### Statements

Expressions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are executed to make something happen.

Expressions with side effects, such as assignments and function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way are known as expression statements.

A similar category of statements are the declaration statements that declare new variables and define new functions.

If a function does not have any side effects, there is no sense in calling it, unless it is part of a larger expression or an assignment statement.

### for/of

The `for/of` loop works with iterable objects. Arrays, strings, sets, and maps are iterable.

Array

    let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], sum = 0;

    for(let element of data) {

    sum += element;

    }

    let text = "Na na na na na na na na";

    let wordSet = new Set(text.split(" "));

    let unique = [];

    for(let word of wordSet) {

    unique.push(word);

    }

String

    let frequency = {};

    for(let letter of "mississippi") {

    if (frequency[letter]) {

    frequency[letter]++;

    }

    else {

    frequency[letter] = 1;

    }

    }

Map

    let m = new Map([[1, "one"]]);

    for(let [key, value] of m) {

    key // => 1

    value // => "one"

    }

Objects are not (by default) iterable. Attempting to use `for/of` on a regular object throws a `TypeError` at runtime.

If you want to iterate through the properties of an object, you can use the `for/in` loop.

Note: `for/of` can be used on objects with `Object.entries` property, but it will not pick properties from object‚Äôs prototype.

### for/in

`for/in` loop works with any object after the `in`.

    for(let p in o) {

    console.log(o[p]);

    }

Note: this will enumerate array indexes, not values.

    for(let i in a) console.log(i);

The `for/in` loop does not actually enumerate all properties of an object. It does not enumerate properties whose names are symbols. And of the properties whose names are strings, it only loops over the `enumerable`properties.

### with

The with statement runs a block of code as if the properties of a specified object were variables in scope for that code.

The `with `statement is forbidden in strict mode and should be considered deprecated in non-strict mode: avoid using it whenever possible.

    document.forms[0].address.value

    with(document.forms[0]) {

    name.value = "";

    address.value = "";

    email.value = "";

    }

### debugger

If a debugger program is available and is running, then an implementation may (but is not required to) perform some kind of debugging action.

In practice, this statement acts like a breakpoint: execution of JavaScript code stops, and you can use the debugger to print variables‚Äô values, examine the call stack, and so on.

Note that it is not enough to have a debugger available: the debugger statement won‚Äôt start the debugger for you. If you‚Äôre using a web browser and have the developer tools console open, however, this statement will cause a breakpoint.

### use strict

Strict mode is a restricted subset of the language that fixes important language deficiencies and provides stronger error checking and increased security.

The differences between strict mode and non-strict mode are the following:

¬∑ The `with `statement is not allowed in strict mode.

¬∑ In strict mode, all variables must be declared: a `ReferenceError `is thrown if you assign a value to an identifier that is not a declared variable, function, function parameter, catch clause parameter, or property of the global object.

¬∑ In non-strict mode, this implicitly declares a global variable by adding a new property to the global object.

¬∑ In strict mode, functions invoked as functions (rather than as methods) have a `this `value of undefined. (In non-strict mode, functions invoked as functions are always passed the global object as their `this `value.)

¬∑ A function is invoked with `call() `or `apply()`¬†, the `this `value is exactly the value passed as the first argument to `call()` or `apply()`. (In non-strict mode, `null `and `undefined `values are replaced with the global object and non-object values are converted to objects.)

¬∑ In strict mode, assignments to non-writable properties and attempts to create new properties on non-extensible objects throw a `TypeError`. (In non-strict mode, these attempts fail silently.)

¬∑ In strict mode, code passed to `eval() `cannot declare variables or define functions in the caller‚Äôs scope as it can in non-strict mode. Instead, variable and function definitions live in a new scope created for the `eval()`. This scope is discarded when the `eval()` returns.

¬∑ In strict mode, the Arguments object in a function holds a static copy of the values passed to the function. In non-strict mode, the Arguments object has ‚Äúmagical‚Äù behavior in which elements of the array and named function parameters both refer to the same value.

¬∑ In strict mode, a `SyntaxError `is thrown if the `delete `operator is followed by an unqualified identifier such as a variable, function, or function parameter. (In non-strict mode, such a `delete `expression does nothing and evaluates to false.)

¬∑ In strict mode, an attempt to delete a non-configurable property throws a `TypeError`. (In non-strict mode, the attempt fails and the delete expression evaluates to false.)

¬∑ In strict mode, it is a syntax error for an object literal to define two or more properties by the same name. (In non-strict mode, no error occurs.)

### Objects

In addition to its name and value, each property has three property attributes:

¬∑ The `writable `attribute specifies whether the value of the property can be set.

¬∑ The `enumerable `attribute specifies whether the property name is returned by a `for/in` loop.

¬∑ The `configurable `attribute specifies whether the property can be deleted and whether its attributes can be altered.

### Prototypes

All objects created by object literals have the same prototype object, `Object.prototype.`

Objects created using the `new `keyword and a constructor invocation use the value of the prototype property of the constructor function as their prototype.

Object created by `new Object()` inherits from `Object.prototype`, just as the object created by `{}` does. Similarly, the object created by `new Array()` uses `Array.prototype` as its prototype, and the object created by` new Date()` uses `Date.prototype` as its prototype.

Almost all objects have a prototype, but only a relatively small number of objects have a `prototype `property. It is these objects with prototype properties that define the prototypes for all the other objects.

Most built-in constructors (and most user-defined constructors) have a prototype that inherits from `Object.prototype`.

`Date.prototype` inherits properties from `Object.prototype`, so a Date object created by `new Date()` inherits properties from both `Date.prototype` and `Object.prototype`. This linked series of prototype objects is known as a prototype chain.

### Creating Objects

Objects can be created with object literals, with the `new` keyword, and with the `Object.create()` function.

Literal

`let empty = {};`

`let point = { x: 0, y: 0 };`

    let book = {

    "main title": "JavaScript",

    "sub-title": "The Definitive Guide",

    for: "all audiences",

    author: {

    firstname: "David", .

    surname: "Flanagan"

    }

    };

`new`

`let o = new Object(); `  
¬†`let a = new Array(); `  
¬†`let d = new Date(); `  
¬†`let r = new Map();`

`Object.create`

`let o3 = Object.create(Object.prototype);`

Use `Object.create` to guard against accidental modifications:

    let o = { x: "don't change this value" };

    library.function(Object.create(o));

Note: the library function can modify the passed in object, but not the original `o` object

### Access Object Properties with an array (\[\])¬†notation

    let addr = "";

    for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {

    addr += customer[`address${i}`] + "\n";

    }

### Inheritance

`let o = {};`

`o.x = 1;`

`let p = Object.create(o);`

`p.y = 2;`

`let q = Object.create(p);`

`q.z = 3;`

Property `x` and `y` available on object `q`

`q.x + q.y`

### How to query for property which may be undefined

`surname = book && book.author && book.author.surname;`

`let surname = book?.author?.surname;`

### Deleting properties

The `delete` operator only deletes own properties, not inherited ones. (To delete an inherited property, you must delete it from the prototype object in which it is defined. Doing this affects every object that inherits from that prototype.)

`delete` does not remove properties that have a `configurable `attribute of false.

Certain properties of built-in objects are non-configurable, as are properties of the global object created by variable declaration and function declaration.

`delete Object.prototype`

false: property is non-configurable

`var x = 1;`

`delete globalThis.x`

false: can‚Äôt delete `this `property

`function f() {}`

`delete globalThis.f`

false

`globalThis.x = 1;`

`delete globalThis.x`

true

### Testing properties

To check whether an object has a property with a given name. You can do this with the `in` operator, with the `hasOwnProperty()` and `propertyIsEnumerable()` methods, or simply by querying the property

(¬†`!= undefined`).

### in &¬†query

`let o = { x: 1 };`

`"x" in o`

true

`o.x !== undefined`

`"y" in o`

false

`o.y !== undefined`

`"toString" in o`

true: o inherits a `toString `property

`o.toString !== undefined`

Advantage of using in: `in` can distinguish between properties that do not exist and properties that exist but have been set to `undefined`.

### hasOwnProperty

`let o = { x: 1 };`

`o.hasOwnProperty("x")`

true

`o.hasOwnProperty("y")`

false

`o.hasOwnProperty("toString")`

false: toString is an inherited property

The `propertyIsEnumerable()` returns true only if the named property is an own property and its `enumerable` attribute is true.

`let o = { x: 1 };`

`o.propertyIsEnumerable("x")`

true

`o.propertyIsEnumerable("toString")`

false: not an own property

`Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable("toString")`

false: not enumerable

### Enumerating properties

To guard against enumerating inherited properties with `for/in`, you can add an explicit check inside the loop body:

    for(let p in o) {

    if (!o.hasOwnProperty(p)) continue;

    }

    for(let p in o) {

    if (typeof o[p] === "function") continue;

    }

Functions you can use to get an array of property names

¬∑ `Object.keys()` returns an array of the names of the enumerable own properties of an object. It does not include non-enumerable properties, inherited properties, or properties whose name is a Symbol.

¬∑ `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` works like `Object.keys() `but returns an array of the names of nonenumerable own properties as well.

¬∑ `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` returns own properties whose names are Symbols, whether or not they are enumerable.

¬∑ `Reflect.ownKeys()` returns all own property names, both enumerable and non-enumerable, and both string and Symbol.

### Extending Objects

To copy the properties of one object to another object

    let target = {x: 1}, source = {y: 2, z: 3};

    for(let key of Object.keys(source)) {

    target[key] = source[key];

    }

One reason to assign properties from one object into another is when you have an object that defines default values for many properties and you want to copy those default properties into another object if a property by that name does not already exist in that object. Using `Object.assign()` naively will not do what you want:

    Object.assign(o, defaults);

overwrites everything in o with defaults

Instead, use one of the following:,

`o = Object.assign({}, defaults, o);`

`o = {...defaults, ...o};`

### Serializing Objects

The functions `JSON.stringify()` and` JSON.parse()` serialize and restore JavaScript objects.

`let o = {x: 1, y: {z: [false, null, ""]}};`

`let s = JSON.stringify(o);`

s == ‚Äò{‚Äúx‚Äù:1,‚Äùy‚Äù:{‚Äúz‚Äù:\[false,null,‚Äù‚Äù\]}}‚Äô

`let p = JSON.parse(s);`

p == {x: 1, y: {z: \[false,null, ‚Äú‚Äù\]}}

### Object methods

`toString(), valueOf(), loLocaleString(), toJSON()`

`let s = { x: 1, y: 1 }.toString();`

s == ‚Äú\[object Object\]‚Äù

### Extended Object Literal¬†Syntax

### Shorthand Properties

    let x = 1, y = 2;

    let o = {

    x: x,

    y: y

    };

‚Üê&gt;

`let x = 1, y = 2;`  
¬†`let o = { x, y };`

### Computer Property¬†Names

`const PROPERTY_NAME = "p1";`  
¬†`function computePropertyName() { return "p" + 2; }`

    let o = {};

    o[PROPERTY_NAME] = 1;

    o[computePropertyName()] = 2;

‚Üê&gt;

    let p = {

    [PROPERTY_NAME]: 1,

    [computePropertyName()]: 2

    };

### Symbols as Property¬†Names

    const extension = Symbol("my extension symbol");

    let o = {

    [extension]: {}

    };

    o[extension].x = 0;

Two Symbols created with the same string argument are still different from one another.

The point of Symbols is not security, but to define a safe extension mechanism for JavaScript objects. If you get an object from third-party code that you do not control and need to add some of your own properties to that object but want to be sure that your properties will not conflict with any properties that may already exist on the object, you can safely use Symbols as your property names.

### Spread Operator

You can copy the properties of an existing object into a new object using the ‚Äúspread operator‚Äù¬†‚Ä¶ inside an object literal:

`let position = { x: 0, y: 0 };`  
¬†`let dimensions = { width: 100, height: 75 };`  
¬†`let rect = { ...position, ...dimensions };`  
¬†`rect.x + rect.y + rect.width + rect.height`

### Shorthand Methods

    let square = {

    area: function() {

    return this.side * this.side; },

    side: 10

    };

‚Üê&gt;

    let square = {

    area() {

    return this.side * this.side; },

    side: 10

    };

When you write a method using this shorthand syntax, the property name can take any of the forms that are legal in an object literal: in addition to a regular JavaScript identifier like the name area above, you can also use string literals and computed property names, which can include Symbol property names:

    const METHOD_NAME = "m";

    const symbol = Symbol();

    let weirdMethods = {

    "method With Spaces"(x) { return x + 1; },

    [METHOD_NAME](x) { return x + 2; },

    [symbol](x) { return x + 3; }

    };

`weirdMethods["method With Spaces"](1)`

2

`weirdMethods[METHOD_NAME](1)`

3

`weirdMethods[symbol](1)`

4

### Property Getters and¬†Setters

    let o = {

    dataProp: value,

    get accessorProp() { return this.dataProp; },

    set accessorProp(value) { this.dataProp = value; }

    };

### Arrays

### Creating Arrays

¬∑ Array literals

¬∑ The¬†‚Ä¶ spread operator on an iterable object

¬∑ The `Array()` constructor

¬∑ The `Array.of()` and `Array.from()` factory methods

### Array literals

`let empty = [];`

`let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];`

`let misc = [ 1.1, true, "a", ];`

`let b = [[1, {x: 1, y: 2}], [2, {x: 3, y: 4}]];`

If an array literal contains multiple commas in a row, with no value between, the array is sparse

`let count = [1,,3];`

`let undefs = [,,];`

Array literal syntax allows an optional trailing comma, so `[,,]` has a length of 2, not 3.

### The Spread¬†Operator

`let a = [1, 2, 3];`

`let b = [0, ...a, 4];`

\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4\]

create a copy of an array‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämodifying the copy does not change the original

`let original = [1,2,3];`  
¬†`let copy = [...original];`

`let digits = [..."0123456789ABCDEF"];`

\[‚Äú0‚Äù,‚Äù1‚Ä≥,‚Äù2‚Ä≥,‚Äù3‚Ä≥,‚Äù4‚Ä≥,‚Äù5‚Ä≥,‚Äù6‚Ä≥,‚Äù7‚Ä≥,‚Äù8‚Ä≥,‚Äù9‚Ä≥,‚ÄùA‚Äù,‚ÄùB‚Äù,‚ÄùC‚Äù,‚ÄùD‚Äù,‚ÄùE‚Äù,‚ÄùF‚Äù\]

`let letters = [..."hello world"];`

\[‚Äúh‚Äù,‚Äùe‚Äù,‚Äùl‚Äù,‚Äùl‚Äù‚Äùo‚Äù,‚Äù‚Äù,‚Äùw‚Äù,‚Äùo‚Äù‚Äùr‚Äù,‚Äùl‚Äù,‚Äùd‚Äù\]

`[...new Set(letters)]`

\[‚Äúh‚Äù,‚Äùe‚Äù,‚Äùl‚Äù,‚Äùo‚Äù,‚Äù‚Äù,‚Äùw‚Äù,‚Äùr‚Äù,‚Äùd‚Äù\]

### Array.of()

When the `Array()` constructor function is invoked with one numeric argument, it uses that argument as an array length. But when invoked with more than one numeric argument, it treats those arguments as elements for the array to be created. This means that the `Array()` constructor cannot be used to create an array with a single numeric element.

`Array.of()`

\[\]

`Array.of(10)`

\[10\]

`Array.of(1,2,3)`

\[1, 2, 3\]

### Array.from()

It is also a simple way to make a copy of an array:

`let copy = Array.from(original);`

`Array.from()` is also important because it defines a way to make a true-array copy of an array-like object. Array-like objects are non-array objects that have a numeric length property and have values stored with properties whose names happen to be integers.

`let truearray = Array.from(arraylike);`

`Array.from()` also accepts an optional second argument. If you pass a function as the second argument, then as the new array is being built, each element from the source object will be passed to the function you specify, and the return value of the function will be stored in the array instead of the original value.

### Reading and Writing Array¬†Elements

What is special about arrays is that when you use property names that are non-negative integers¬†, the array automatically maintains the value of the `length` property for you.

JavaScript converts the numeric array index you specify to a string‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe index 1 becomes the string ‚Äú1‚Äù, then uses that string as a property name.

It is helpful to clearly distinguish an array index from an object property name. All indexes are property names, but only property names that are integers between 0 and 231 are indexes. All arrays are objects, and you can create properties of any name on them. If you use properties that are array indexes, however, arrays have the special behavior of updating their `length` property as needed.

Note that you can index an array using numbers that are negative or that are not integers. When you do this, the number is converted to a string, and that string is used as the property name. Since the name is not a non-negative integer, it is treated as a regular object property, not an array index.

`a[-1.23] = true;`

This creates a property named ‚Äú-1.23‚Äù

`a["1000"] = 0;`

This the 1001st element of the array

`a[1.000] = 1;`

Array index 1. Same as a\[1\] = 1;

The fact that array indexes are simply a special type of object property name means that JavaScript arrays have no notion of an ‚Äúout of bounds‚Äù error. When you try to query a nonexistent property of any object, you don‚Äôt get an error; you simply get `undefined`.

### Sparse Arrays

Sparse arrays can be created with the `Array()` constructor or simply by assigning to an array index larger than the current array length.

`a[1000] = 0;`

Assignment adds one element but sets length to 1001.

you can also make an array sparse with the `delete` operator.

Note that when you omit a value in an array literal (using repeated commas as in `[1,,3]`), the resulting array is sparse, and the omitted elements simply do not exist

### Array Length

if you set the length property to a nonnegative integer `n` smaller than its current value, any array elements whose index is greater than or equal to n are deleted from the array.

`a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.length = 3;`

a is now \[1,2,3\].

`a.length = 0;`

Delete all elements. a is \[\].

`a.length = 5;`

Length is 5, but no elements, like `new Array(5)`

You can also set the length property of an array to a value larger than its current value. Doing this does not actually add any new elements to the array; it simply creates a sparse area at the end of the array.

### Adding and Deleting Array¬†Elements

`let a = [];`

`a[0] = "zero";`

`a[1] = "one";`

add elements to it.

You can also use the `push()` method to add one or more values to the end of an array.

You can use the` unshift()` method to insert a value at the beginning of an array, shifting the existing array elements to higher indexes.

The `pop()` method is the opposite of `push()`: it removes the last element of the array and returns it, reducing the length of an array by 1.

Similarly, the `shift()` method removes and returns the first element of the array, reducing the length by 1 and shifting all elements down to an index one lower than their current index.

You can delete array elements with the delete operator

`let a = [1,2,3];`

`delete a[2];`

a now has no element at index 2

`2 in a`

false

`a.length`

3: delete does not affect array length

### Iterating Arrays

The easiest way to loop through each of the elements of an array (or any iterable object) is with the `for/of`loop

    let letters = [..."Hello world"];

    let string = "";

    for(let letter of letters) {

    string += letter;

    }

It has no special behavior for sparse arrays and simply returns `undefined` for any array elements that do not exist.

If you want to use a `for/of` loop for an array and need to know the index of each array element, use the `entries()` method of the array

    let letters = [..."Hello world"];

    let everyother = "";

    for(let [index, letter] of letters.entries()) {

    if (index % 2 === 0) everyother += letter;

    }

Another good way to iterate arrays is with `forEach()`. This is not a new form of the for loop, but an array method that offers a functional approach to array iteration.

    let letters = [..."Hello world"];

    let uppercase = "";

    letters.forEach(letter => {

    uppercase += letter.toUpperCase();

    });

You can also loop through the elements of an array with a `for` loop.

    for(let i = 0, len = letters.length; i < len; i++) {

    // loop body

    }

### Multidimensional Arrays

### Create a multidimensional array

`let table = new Array(10);`

    for(let i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {

    table[i] = new Array(10);

    }

    for(let row = 0; row < table.length; row++) {

    for(let col = 0; col < table[row].length; col++) {

    table[row][col] = row * col;

    }

    }

### Array Methods

### Array Iterator¬†Methods

First, all of these methods accept a function as their first argument and invoke that function once for each element (or some elements) of the array. If the array is sparse, the function you pass is not invoked for nonexistent elements. In most cases, the function you supply is invoked with three arguments: the value of the array element, the index of the array element, and the array itself.

FOREACH()

`let data = [1,2,3,4,5], sum = 0;`

    data.forEach(value => { sum += value; });

    data.forEach(function(v, i, a) {

    a[i] = v + 1;

    });

15

\[2,3,4,5,6\]

MAP()

`let a = [1, 2, 3];`  
¬†`a.map(x => x*x)`

\[1, 4, 9\]

FILTER()

`let a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];`  
¬†`a.filter(x => x < 3) `  
¬†`a.filter((x,i) => i % 2 === 0)`

\[2, 1\];

\[5, 3, 1\];

FIND()

FINDINDEX()

`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.findIndex(x => x === 3)`

`a.find(x => x % 5 === 0)`

`a.find(x => x % 7 === 0)`

2

5

undefined

EVERY()

SOME()

`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.every(x => x < 10)`

`a.some(x => x % 2 === 0)`

`a.some(isNaN)`

true

true

false

REDUCE()

ReduceRight()

l`et a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.reduce((x,y) => x+y, 0)`

`a.reduce((x,y) => x*y, 1)`

`a.reduce((x,y) => (x > y) ? x : y)`

15

120

5

Note that `map()` returns a new array: it does not modify the array it is invoked on. If that array is sparse, your function will not be called for the missing elements, but the returned array will be sparse in the same way as the original array: it will have the same length and the same missing elements.

To close the gaps in a sparse array, you can do this:

`let dense = sparse.filter(() => true);`

And to close gaps and remove undefined and null elements, you can use filter, like this:

`a = a.filter(x => x !== undefined && x !== null);`

Unlike `filter()`, however,` find()` and `findIndex()` stop iterating the first time the predicate finds an element. When that happens, `find()` returns the matching element, and `findIndex()` returns the index of the matching element. If no matching element is found,` find()` returns `undefined` and` findIndex()`returns -1.

When you invoke `reduce()` with no initial value, it uses the first element of the array as the initial value.

`reduceRight()` works just like `reduce()`, except that it processes the array from highest index to lowest (right-to-left), rather than from lowest to highest. You might want to do this if the reduction operation has right-to-left associativity

### Flattening arrays with `flat()` and `flatMap()`

`[1, [2, 3]].flat()`

\[1, 2, 3\]

`[1, [2, [3]]].flat()`

\[1, 2, \[3\]\]

`let a = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];`

`a.flat(1)`

`a.flat(2)`

`a.flat(3)`

`a.flat(4)`

\[1, 2, \[3, \[4\]\]\]

\[1, 2, 3, \[4\]\]

\[1, 2, 3, 4\]

\[1, 2, 3, 4\]

`let phrases = ["hello world", "the definitive guide"];`  
¬†`let words = phrases.flatMap(phrase => phrase.split(" "));`

\[‚Äúhello‚Äù, ‚Äúworld‚Äù, ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúdefinitive‚Äù, ‚Äúguide‚Äù\];

Calling `a.flatMap(f)` is the same as (but more efficient than) `a.map(f).flat()`:

### Adding arrays with¬†concat()

`let a = [1,2,3];`

`a.concat(4, 5)`

\[1,2,3,4,5\]

`a.concat([4,5],[6,7])`

\[1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]

### Stacks and Queues with push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift()

The `push()` and` pop()` methods allow you to work with arrays as if they were stacks. The `push()` method appends one or more new elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

The `unshift()` and `shift()` methods behave much like `push()` and` pop()`, except that they insert and remove elements from the beginning of an array rather than from the end.

You can implement a queue data structure by using `push()` to add elements at the end of an array and `shift()` to remove them from the start of the array. Note differences in `unshift `with single and multiple values.

`let a = [];`

`a.unshift(1)`

\[1\]

`a.unshift(2)`

\[2, 1\]

`a = [];`

`a.unshift(1,2)`

\[1, 2\]

### Subarrays with `slice(), splice(), fill()`, and `copyWithin()`

SLICE()

`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.slice(0,3);`

`a.slice(3);`

`a.slice(1,-1);`

`a.slice(-3,-2);`

\[1,2,3\]

\[4,5\]

\[2,3,4\]

\[3\]

SPLICE

`let a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];`

`a.splice(4)`

`a.splice(1,2)`

`a.splice(1,1)`

`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.splice(2,0,"a","b")`

`a.splice(2,2,[1,2],3)`

\[5,6,7,8\]; `a` is now \[1,2,3,4\]

\[2,3\]; a is now \[1,4\]

\[4\]; a is now \[1\]

\[\]; a is now \[1,2,‚Äùa‚Äù,‚Äùb‚Äù,3,4,5\]

\[‚Äúa‚Äù,‚Äùb‚Äù\]; a is now \[1,2,\[1,2\],3,3,4,5\]

FILL()

`let a = new Array(5);`

`a.fill(0)`

`a.fill(9, 1)`

`a.fill(8, 2, -1)`

\[0,0,0,0,0\]

\[0,9,9,9,9\]

\[0,9,8,8,9\]

COPYWITHIN()

`let a = [1,2,3,4,5];`

`a.copyWithin(1)`

`a.copyWithin(2, 3, 5)`

`a.copyWithin(0, -2)`

\[1,1,2,3,4\]

\[1,1,3,4,4\]

\[4,4,3,4,4\]

`splice()` is a general-purpose method for inserting or removing elements from an array.` splice()` can delete elements from an array, insert new elements into an array, or perform both operations at the same time.

The first argument to `splice()` specifies the array position at which the insertion and/or deletion is to begin. The second argument specifies the number of elements that should be deleted from (spliced out of) the array.

Unlike `concat(), splice()` inserts arrays themselves, not the elements of those arrays.

`copyWithin()` copies a slice of an array to a new position within the array. It modifies the array in place and returns the modified array, but it will not change the length of the array.

### Array Searching and Sorting¬†Methods

INDEXOF()  
¬†LASTINDEXOF()

`let a = [0,1,2,1,0];`

`a.indexOf(1)`

`a.lastIndexOf(1)`

`a.indexOf(3)`

1

3

-1

SORT()

`let a = [33, 4, 1111, 222];`

`a.sort();`

`a.sort((a,b) => a - b);`

Case-insensitive sort

    let a = ["ant", "Bug", "cat", "Dog"];

    a.sort(); // a == ["Bug","Dog","ant","cat"];

    a.sort(function(s,t) {

    let a = s.toLowerCase();

    let b = t.toLowerCase();

    if (a < b) return -1;

    if (a > b) return 1;

    return 0;

    });

`[1111, 222, 33, 4];`

`[4, 33, 222, 1111]`

REVERSE()

`let a = [1,2,3];`  
¬†`a.reverse();`

\[3,2,1\]

`indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` compare their argument to the array elements using the equivalent of the === operator. If your array contains objects instead of primitive values, these methods check to see if two references both refer to exactly the same object. If you want to actually look at the content of an object, try using the `find()` method with your own custom predicate function instead.

`indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` take an optional second argument that specifies the array index at which to begin the search. Negative values are allowed for the second argument and are treated as an offset from the end of the array.

`indexOf()` will not detect the NaN value in an array, but `includes()` will

When `sort()` is called with no arguments, it sorts the array elements in alphabetical order. To sort an array into some order other than alphabetical, you must pass a comparison function as an argument to `sort()`.

### Array to String Conversions

The `join()` method converts all the elements of an array to strings and concatenates them, returning the resulting string.

`let a = [1, 2, 3];`

`a.join()`

`a.join(" ")`

`a.join("")`

‚Äú1,2,3‚Äù

‚Äú1 2 3‚Äù

‚Äú123‚Äù

`let b = new Array(10);`

`b.join("-")`

‚Äú‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äî -‚Äù

Arrays, like all JavaScript objects, have a `toString()` method. For an array, this method works just like the `join()` method with no arguments:

`[1,2,3].toString()`

‚Äú1,2,3‚Äù

`["a", "b", "c"].toString()`

‚Äúa,b,c‚Äù

`[1, [2,"c"]].toString()`

‚Äú1,2,c‚Äù

### Static Array Functions

`Array.isArray([])`

true

`Array.isArray({})`

false

### Array-Like Objects

It is often perfectly reasonable to treat any object with a numeric `length` property and corresponding non-negative integer properties as a kind of array.

    let a = {};

    let i = 0;

    while(i < 10) {

    a[i] = i * i;

    i++;

    }

    a.length = i;

    // Now iterate through it as if it were a real array

    let total = 0;

    for(let j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {

    total += a[j];

    }

Since array-like objects do not inherit from `Array.prototype`, you cannot invoke array methods on them directly. You can invoke them indirectly using the `Function.call` method.

`let a = {"0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c", length: 3};`

// An array-like object

`Array.prototype.join.call(a, "+")`

‚Äúa+b+c‚Äù

`Array.prototype.join.call("JavaScript", " ")`

‚ÄúJ a v a S c r i p t‚Äù

`Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase())`

\[‚ÄúA‚Äù,‚ÄùB‚Äù,‚ÄùC‚Äù\]

`Array.from(a)`

\[‚Äúa‚Äù,‚Äùb‚Äù,‚Äùc‚Äù\]

### Strings as¬†Arrays

`let s = "test";`

`s.charAt(0)`

t

`s[1]`

e

### Functions

In addition to the arguments, each invocation has another value‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe invocation context‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat is the value of the `this` keyword.

### Function Declarations

    function printprops(o) {

    for(let p in o) {

    console.log(`${p}: ${o[p]}\n`);

    }

    }

Function declaration statements are ‚Äúhoisted‚Äù to the top of the enclosing script, function, or block so that functions defined in this way may be invoked from code that appears before the definition.

### Function Expressions

`const square = function(x) { return x*x; };`

    const f = function fact(x) {

    if (x <= 1) return 1;

    return x * fact(x-1);

    }

Function expressions can include names, which is useful for recursion

`[3,2,1].sort(function(a,b) { return a - b; });`

Function expressions can also be used as arguments to other functions

`let tensquared = (function(x) {return x*x;}(10));`

Function expressions are sometimes defined and immediately invoked

### Arrow Functions

`const sum = (x, y) => { return x + y; };`

`const sum = (x, y) => x + y;`

no need for `return`

`const polynomial = x => x*x + 2*x + 3;`

omit parens with single parameter

`const constantFunc = () => 42;`

usage for no params

If the body of your arrow function is a single return statement but the expression to be returned is an object literal, then you have to put the object literal inside parentheses to avoid syntactic ambiguity between the curly braces of a function body and the curly braces of an object literal

`const f = x => { return { value: x }; };`

good

`const g = x => ({ value: x });`

good

`const h = x => { value: x };`

returns nothing

`const i = x => { v: x, w: x };`

syntax error

Arrow functions differ from functions defined in other ways in one critical way: they inherit the value of the `this` keyword from the environment in which they are defined rather than defining their own invocation context as functions defined in other ways do.

### Nested Functions

    function hypotenuse(a, b) {

    function square(x) { return x*x; }

    return Math.sqrt(square(a) + square(b));

    }

### Invoking Functions

For function invocation in non-strict mode, the invocation context (the `this` value) is the global object. In strict mode, however, the invocation context is `undefined`.

`const strict = (function() { return !this; }())`

Determine if we‚Äôre in strict mode

### Constructor Invocation

A constructor invocation creates a new, empty object that inherits from the object specified by the `prototype`property of the constructor.

### Indirect invocation

JavaScript functions are objects, and like all JavaScript objects, they have methods. Two of these methods, `call()` and `apply()`, invoke the function indirectly. Both methods allow you to explicitly specify the `this `value for the invocation, which means you can invoke any function as a method of any object, even if it is not actually a method of that object.

### Function Arguments and Parameters

### Optional Parameters and¬†Defaults

When a function is invoked with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the additional parameters are set to their default value, which is normally `undefined`.

    function getPropertyNames(o, a) {

    a = a || [];

    for(let property in o) a.push(property);

    return a;

    }

    function getPropertyNames(o, a = []) {

    for(let property in o) a.push(property);

    return a;

    }

One interesting case is that, for functions with multiple parameters, you can use the value of a previous parameter to define the default value of the parameters that follow it

    const rectangle = (width, height = width*2) => ({width, height});

### Rest Parameters and Variable-Length Argument¬†Lists

Rest parameters enable us to write functions that can be invoked with arbitrarily more arguments than parameters.

    function max(first=-Infinity, ...rest) {

    let maxValue = first;

    for(let n of rest) {

    if (n > maxValue) {

    maxValue = n;

    }

    }

    return maxValue;

    }

    max(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 1000, 4, 5, 6)

1000

within the body of a function, the value of a rest parameter will always be an array. The array may be empty, but a rest parameter will never be `undefined`.

This type of function is called variadic functions, variable arity functions, or vararg functions.

### The Arguments Object

Within the body of any function, the identifier `arguments` refers to the Arguments object for that invocation.

    function max(x) {

    let maxValue = -Infinity;

    for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {

    if (arguments[i] > maxValue)

    maxValue = arguments[i];

    }

    return maxValue;

    }

    max(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 1000, 4, 5, 6)

1000

you should avoid using it in any new code you write.

### The Spread Operator for Function¬†Calls

    let numbers = [5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1];

    Math.min(...numbers)

-1

    function timed(f) {

    return function(...args) {

    console.log(`Entering function ${f.name}`);

    let startTime = Date.now();

    try {

    return f(...args);

    }

    finally {

    console.log(`Exiting ${f.name} after ${Date.now() - startTime}ms`);

    }

    };

    }

    // Compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and n by brute force

    function benchmark(n) {

    let sum = 0;

    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) sum += i;

    return sum;

    }

    // Now invoke the timed version of that test function

    timed(benchmark)(1000000)

### Destructuring Function Arguments into Parameters

    function vectorAdd(v1, v2) {

    return [v1[0] + v2[0], v1[1] + v2[1]];

    }

    vectorAdd([1,2], [3,4])

‚Üê&gt;

    function vectorAdd([x1,y1], [x2,y2]) {

    return [x1 + x2, y1 + y2];

    }

    vectorAdd([1,2], [3,4])

    function vectorMultiply({x, y}, scalar) {

    return { x: x*scalar, y: y*scalar };

    }

    vectorMultiply({x: 1, y: 2}, 2)

‚Üê&gt;

    function vectorMultiply({x,y}, scalar) {

    return { x: x*scalar, y: y*scalar};

    }

    vectorMultiply({x: 1, y: 2}, 2)

### Argument Types

Adding code to check the types of arguments

    function sum(a) {

    let total = 0;

    for(let element of a) {

    if (typeof element !== "number") {

    throw new TypeError("sum(): elements must be numbers");

    }

    total += element;

    }

    return total;

    }

`sum([1,2,3])`

6

`sum(1, 2, 3);`

`TypeError`: 1 is not iterable

`sum([1,2,"3"]);`

`TypeError`: element 2 is not a number

### Functions as¬†Values

    function square(x) { return x * x; }

`let s = square;`

`square(4)`

16

`s(4)`

16

Functions can also be assigned to object properties rather than variables.

`let o = {square: function(x) { return x*x; }};`

`let y = o.square(16);`

256

Functions don‚Äôt even require names at all, as when they‚Äôre assigned to array elements:

`let a = [x => x*x, 20];`

`a[0](a[1])`

400

`a[0]` accesses first element of the array, which is ‚Äú`x => x*x`‚Äú, `(a[1])` passes parameter, which is 20.

### Examples of using functions as¬†data

    function add(x,y) { return x + y; }

    function subtract(x,y) { return x - y; }

    function multiply(x,y) { return x * y; }

    function divide(x,y) { return x / y; }

    function operate(operator, operand1, operand2) {

    return operator(operand1, operand2);

    }

`let i = operate(add, operate(add, 2, 3), operate(multiply, 4,5));`

`(2+3) + (4*5):`

or:

    const operators = {

    add: (x,y) => x+y,

    subtract: (x,y) => x-y,

    multiply: (x,y) => x*y,

    divide: (x,y) => x/y,

    pow: Math.pow

    };

    function operate2(operation, operand1, operand2) {

    if (typeof operators[operation] === "function") {

    return operators[operation](operand1, operand2);

    }

    else throw "unknown operator";

    }

`operate2("add", "hello", operate2("add", " ", "world"))`

// ‚Äúhello world‚Äù

`operate2("pow", 10, 2)`

100

### Defining Your Own Function Properties

When a function needs a ‚Äústatic‚Äù variable whose value persists across invocations, it is often convenient to use a property of the function itself.

For example, suppose you want to write a function that returns a unique integer whenever it is invoked. The function must never return the same value twice. In order to manage this, the function needs to keep track of the values it has already returned, and this information must persist across function invocations.

    uniqueInteger.counter = 0;

    function uniqueInteger() {

    return uniqueInteger.counter++;

    }

    uniqueInteger()

0

    uniqueInteger()

1

Compute factorials and cache results as properties of the function itself.

    function factorial(n) {

    if (Number.isInteger(n) && n > 0) {

    if (!(n in factorial)) {

    factorial[n] = n * factorial(n-1);

    }

    return factorial[n];

    }

    else {

    return NaN;

    }

    }

    factorial[1] = 1;

Initialize the cache to hold this base case.

    factorial(6)

720

    factorial[5]

120; the call above caches this value

### Functions as Namespaces

Variables declared within a function are not visible outside of the function. For this reason, it is sometimes useful to define a function simply to act as a temporary namespace in which you can define variables without cluttering the global namespace.

Variables that would have been global become local to the function. Following code defines only a single global variable: the function name `chunkNamespace`.

    function chunkNamespace() {

    // Chunk of code goes here

    // Any variables defined in the chunk are local to this function

    // instead of cluttering up the global namespace.

    }

    chunkNamespace();

If defining even a single property is too much, you can define and invoke an anonymous function in a single expression‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIIEF (immediately invoked function expression)

    (function() {

    // chunkNamespace() function rewritten as an unnamed expression.

    // Chunk of code goes here

    }());

### Closures

JavaScript uses lexical scoping. This means that functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effect when they are invoked.

In order to implement lexical scoping, the internal state of a JavaScript function object must include not only the code of the function but also a reference to the scope in which the function definition appears.

This combination of a function object and a scope (a set of variable bindings) in which the function‚Äôs variables are resolved is called a closure.

Closures become interesting when they are invoked from a different scope than the one they were defined in. This happens most commonly when a nested function object is returned from the function within which it was defined.

    let scope = "global scope";

    function checkscope() {

    let scope = "local scope";

    function f() { return scope; }

    return f();

    }

`checkscope()`

‚Äúlocal scope‚Äù

    let scope = "global scope";

    function checkscope() {

    let scope = "local scope";

    function f() { return scope; }

    return f;

    }

`let s = checkscope()();`

‚Äúlocal scope‚Äù

Closures capture the local variables of a single function invocation and can use those variables as private state.

    let uniqueInteger = (function() {

    let counter = 0;

    return function() { return counter++; };

    }());

`uniqueInteger()`

0

`uniqueInteger()`

1

it is the return value of the function that is being assigned to `uniqueInteger`.

Private variables like counter need not be exclusive to a single closure: it is perfectly possible for two or more nested functions to be defined within the same outer function and share the same scope.

    function counter() {

    let n = 0;

    return {

    count: function() { return n++; },

    reset: function() { n = 0; }

    };

    }

`let c = counter(), d = counter();`

`c.count()`

0

`d.count()`

0

`c.reset();`

`c.count()`

0

`d.count()`

1

You can combine this closure technique with property getters and setters

    function counter(n) {

    return {

    get count() { return n++; },

    set count(m) {

    if (m > n) n = m;

    else throw Error("count can only be set to a larger value")

    }

    };

    }

`let c = counter(1000);`

`c.count`

1000

`c.count`

1001

`c.count = 2000;`

`c.count`

2000

`c.count = 2000;`

Error: count can only be set to a larger value

Define a private variable and two nested functions to get and set the value of that variable.

    function addPrivateProperty(o, name, predicate) {

    let value;

    o[`get${name}`] = function() { return value; };

    o[`set${name}`] = function(v) {

    if (predicate && !predicate(v)) {

    throw new TypeError(`set${name}: invalid value ${v}`);

    }

    else {

    value = v;

    }

    };

    }

`let o = {};`

`addPrivateProperty(o, "Name", x => typeof x === "string");`

`o.setName("Frank");`

`o.getName()`

‚ÄúFrank‚Äù

`o.setName(0);`

TypeError: try to set a value ofthe wrong type

### Function Properties, Methods, and Constructor

Since functions are objects, they can have properties and methods, just like any other object.

### The length¬†Property

The read-only length property of a function specifies the arity of the function‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe number of parameters it declares in its parameter list, which is usually the number of arguments that the function expects.

### The name¬†Property

This property is primarily useful when writing debugging or error messages.

### The prototype Property

When a function is used as a constructor, the newly created object inherits properties from the prototype object.

### The call() and apply()¬†Methods

`call()` and `apply()` allow you to indirectly invoke a function as if it were a method of some other object. The first argument to both `call()` and `apply()` is the object on which the function is to be invoked; this argument is the invocation context and becomes the value of the `this` keyword within the body of the function.

To invoke the function` f()` as a method of the object o (passing no arguments),

`f.call(o);`

`f.apply(o);`

To pass two numbers to the function `f()` and invoke it as if it were a method of the object o,

    f.call(o, 1, 2);

The `apply()` method is like the `call()` method, except that the arguments to be passed to the function are specified as an array:

    f.apply(o, [1,2]);

The `trace() `function defined uses the `apply() `method instead of a spread operator, and by doing that, it is able to invoke the wrapped method with the same arguments and the same this value as the wrapper method

    function trace(o, m) {

    let original = o[m];

    o[m] = function(...args) {

    console.log(new Date(), "Entering:", m);

    let result = original.apply(this, args);

    console.log(new Date(), "Exiting:", m);

    return result;

    };

    }

### The bind()¬†Method

The primary purpose of `bind()` is to bind a function to an object.

`function f(y) { return this.x + y; }`

`let o = { x: 1 };`

`let g = f.bind(o);`

`g(2)`

3

`let p = { x: 10, g };`

`p.g(2)`

3 // g is still bound to o, not p.

The most common use case for calling `bind()` is to make non-arrow functions behave like arrow functions.

Partial application is a common technique in functional programming and is sometimes called `currying`.

`let sum = (x,y) => x + y;`

`let succ = sum.bind(null, 1);`

`succ(2)`

3

### The toString() Method

Most (but not all) implementations of this `toString()` method return the complete source code for the function

### The Function() Constructor

The Function() constructor is best thought of as a globally scoped version of `eval()` that defines new variables and functions in its own private scope. You will probably never need to use this constructor in your code.

### Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that operates on functions, taking one or more functions as arguments and returning a new function.

    function not(f) {

    return function(...args) {

    let result = f.apply(this, args);

    return !result;

    };

    }

`const even = x => x % 2 === 0;`

A function to determine if a number is even

`const odd = not(even);`

`[1,1,3,5,5].every(odd)`

true

Returns a new function that maps one array to another

    const map = function(a, ...args) { return a.map(...args); };

    function mapper(f) {

    return a => map(a, f);

    }

    const increment = x => x + 1;

    const incrementAll = mapper(increment);

    incrementAll([1,2,3]

\[2,3,4\]

Example that takes two functions, f and g, and returns a new function that computes f(g()):

    function compose(f, g) {

    return function(...args) {

    return f.call(this, g.apply(this, args));

    };

    }

`const sum = (x,y) => x+y;`

`const square = x => x*x;`

`compose(square, sum)(2,3)`

### Memoization

We defined a factorial function that cached its previously computed results. In functional programming, this kind of caching is called memoization.

### Classes

JavaScript‚Äôs classes and prototype-based inheritance mechanism are substantially different from the classes and class-based inheritance mechanism of Java.

### Classes and Prototypes

If we define a prototype object and then use `Object.create()` to create objects that inherit from it, we have defined a JavaScript class.

Factory function that returns a new range object:

    function range(from, to) {

    let r = Object.create(range.methods);

    r.from = from;

    r.to = to;

    return r;

    }

    range.methods = {

    includes(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; },

    *[Symbol.iterator]() {

    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)

    yield x;

    },

    toString() { return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to +")"; }

    };

`let r = range(1,3);`

`r.includes(2)`

true

`r.toString()`

‚Äú(1‚Ä¶3)‚Äù

`[...r]`

\[1, 2, 3\]

### Classes and Constructors

A constructor is a function designed for the initialization of newly created objects.

The critical feature of constructor invocations is that the `prototype` property of the constructor is used as the prototype of the new object.

While almost all objects have a prototype, only a few objects have a `prototype` property. It is function objects that have a `prototype` property.

This means that all objects created with the same constructor function inherit from the same object and are therefore members of the same class.

A Range class using a constructor

    function Range(from, to) {

    this.from = from;

    this.to = to;

    }

    Range.prototype = {

    includes: function(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; },

    [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {

    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)

    yield x;

    },

    toString: function() { return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")"; }

    };

`let r = new Range(1,3);`

`r.includes(2)`

true

`r.toString()`

‚Äú(1‚Ä¶3)‚Äù

`[...r]`

\[1, 2, 3\]

Because the `Range() `constructor is invoked with `new`, it does not have to call `Object.create()` or take any action to create a new object.

In the first example, the prototype was `range.methods`. This was a convenient and descriptive name, but arbitrary. In the second example, the prototype is `Range.prototype`, and this name is mandatory.

An invocation of the `Range()` constructor automatically uses `Range.prototype` as the prototype of the `new Range` object.

### Constructors, Class Identity, and instanceof

Two objects are instances of the same class if and only if they inherit from the same prototype object.

The `instanceof` operator is not checking whether `r` was actually initialized by the Range constructor. Instead, it is checking whether `r` inherits from `Range.prototype`.

    function Strange() {}

    Strange.prototype = Range.prototype;

    new Strange() instanceof Range

true

If you want to test the prototype chain of an object for a specific prototype and do not want to use the constructor function as an intermediary, you can use the `isPrototypeOf()` method

    range.methods.isPrototypeOf(r);

### The constructor Property

Every regular JavaScript function automatically has a `prototype` property. The value of this property is an object that has a single, non-enumerable `constructor` property.

The value of the `constructor` property is the function object

    let F = function() {};

    let p = F.prototype;

    let c = p.constructor;

    c === F

true

`let o = new F();`

`o.constructor === F`

true

Instances of the Range class, as defined, do not have a constructor property. We can remedy this problem by explicitly adding a constructor to the prototype:

    Range.prototype = {

    constructor: Range

    };

Another common technique that you are likely to see in older JavaScript code is to use the predefined prototype object with its constructor property and add methods to it one at a time with code like this:

    Range.prototype.includes = function(x) {

    return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;

    };

    Range.prototype.toString = function() {

    return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")";

    };

### Classes with the class¬†Keyword

    class Range {

    constructor(from, to) {

    this.from = from;

    this.to = to;

    }

    includes(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; }

    *[Symbol.iterator]() {

    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)

    yield x;

    }

    toString() { return `(${this.from}...${this.to})`; }

    }

`let r = new Range(1,3);`

`r.includes(2)`

true

`r.toString()`

(1‚Ä¶3)

`[...r]`

\[1, 2, 3\]

Although class bodies are superficially similar to object literals, they are not the same thing. In particular, they do not support the definition of properties with name/value pairs.

If your class does not need to do any initialization, you can omit the constructor keyword and its body, and an empty constructor function will be implicitly created for you.

If you want to define a class that subclasses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor inherits from‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääanother class, you can use the `extends` keyword with the class keyword:

    class Span extends Range {

    constructor(start, length) {

    if (length >= 0) {

    super(start, start + length);

    }

    else {

    super(start + length, start);

    }

    }

    }

class declarations have both statement and expression forms

`let Square = class { constructor(x) { this.area = x * x; } };`

`new Square(3).area`

9

### Static methods

You can define a `static` method within a class body by prefixing the method declaration with the `static` keyword. Static methods are defined as properties of the constructor function rather than properties of the prototype object.

    static parse(s) {

    let matches = s.match(/^\((\d+)\.\.\.(\d+)\)$/);

    if (!matches) {

    throw new TypeError(`Cannot parse Range from "${s}".`)

    }

    return new Range(parseInt(matches[1]),

    parseInt(matches[2]));

    }

The method defined by this code is `Range.parse()`, not `Range.prototype.parse()`, and you must invoke it through the constructor, not through an instance:

    let r = Range.parse('(1...10)');

### Getters, Setters, and other Method¬†Forms

Within a class body, you can define getter and setter methods just as you can in object literals. The only difference is that in class bodies, you don‚Äôt put a comma after the getter or setter.

### Public, Private, and Static¬†Fields

The ES6 standard only allows the creation of methods (including getters, setters, and generators) and static methods; it does not include syntax for defining fields.

If you want to define a field on a class instance, you must do that in the constructor function or in one of the methods. And if you want to define a static field for a class, you must do that outside the class body, after the class has been defined.

Standardization is underway, however, for extended class syntax that allows the definition of instance and static fields, in both public and private forms.

    class Buffer {

    constructor() {

    this.size = 0;

    this.capacity = 4096;

    this.buffer = new Uint8Array(this.capacity);

    }

    }

‚Üê&gt;

    class Buffer {

    size = 0;

    capacity = 4096;

    buffer = new Uint8Array(this.capacity);

    }

The same proposal that seeks to standardize these instance fields also defines private (with the \# prefix) instance fields.

    class Buffer {

    #size = 0;

    get size() { return this.#size; }

    }

A related proposal seeks to standardize the use of the `static` keyword for fields.

    static integerRangePattern = /^\((\d+)\.\.\.(\d+)\)$/;

    static parse(s) {

    let matches = s.match(Range.integerRangePattern);

    if (!matches) {

    throw new TypeError(`Cannot parse Range from "${s}".`)

    }

    return new Range(parseInt(matches[1]), matches[2]);

    }

### Adding Methods to Existing¬†Classes

We can augment JavaScript classes simply by adding new methods to their prototype objects.

    if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {

    String.prototype.startsWith = function(s) {

    return this.indexOf(s) === 0;

    };

    }

    Number.prototype.times = function(f, context) {

    let n = this.valueOf();

    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) f.call(context, i);

    };

### Subclasses

### Subclasses and Prototypes

Span subclass of the Range class. This subclass will work just like a Range, but instead of initializing it with a start and an end, we‚Äôll instead specify a start and a distance, or span.

    function Span(start, span) {

    if (span >= 0) {

    this.from = start;

    this.to = start + span;

    }

    else {

    this.to = start;

    this.from = start + span;

    }

    }

Ensure that the `Span` prototype inherits from the `Range`

    Span.prototype = Object.create(Range.prototype);

We don‚Äôt want to inherit `Range.prototype.constructor`, so we define our own constructor property:

    Span.prototype.constructor = Span;

`Span` overrides the `toString()` method

`Span.prototype.toString = function() {`  
¬†`` return `(${this.from}... +${this.to - this.from})`; ``  
¬†`};`

A robust subclassing mechanism needs to allow classes to invoke the methods and constructor of their superclass, but prior to ES6, JavaScript did not have a simple way to do these things.

### Subclasses with extends and¬†super

    class EZArray extends Array {

    get first() { return this[0]; }

    get last() { return this[this.length-1]; }

    }

`let a = new EZArray();`

`a instanceof EZArray`

true

`a instanceof Array`

true

`a.push(1,2,3,4);`

`a.pop()`

4

`a.first`

1

`a.last`

3

`Array.isArray(a)`

true

`EZArray.isArray(a)`

true

`Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(EZArray.prototype`

true

`Array.isPrototypeOf(EZArray)`

true

Example demonstrates the use of the `super` keyword to invoke the constructor and methods of the superclass

    class TypedMap extends Map {

    constructor(keyType, valueType, entries) {

    if (entries) {

    for(let [k, v] of entries) {

    if (typeof k !== keyType || typeof v !== valueType) {

    throw new TypeError(`Wrong type for entry [${k}, ${v}]`);

    }

    }

    }

    super(entries);

    this.keyType = keyType;

    this.valueType = valueType;

    }

    set(key, value) {

    if (this.keyType && typeof key !== this.keyType) {

    throw new TypeError(`${key} is not of type${this.keyType}`);

    }

    if (this.valueType && typeof value !== this.valueType)

    {

    throw new TypeError(`${value} is not of type ${this.valueType}`);

    }

    return super.set(key, value);

    }

    }

You may not use the `this` keyword in your constructor until after you have invoked the superclass constructor with `super()`. This enforces a rule that superclasses get to initialize themselves before subclasses do.

Once private fields are supported, we could change these properties to `#keyType` and `#valueType` so that they could not be altered from the outside.

### Class Hierarchies and Abstract¬†Classes

Define abstract classes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääclasses that do not include a complete implementation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto serve as a common superclass for a group of related subclasses.

### Modules

### Automating Closure-Based Modularity

Imagine a tool that takes a set of files, wraps the content of each of those files within an immediately invoked function expression, keeps track of the return value of each function, and concatenates everything into one big file.

    const modules = {};

    function require(moduleName) { return modules[moduleName]; }

    modules["sets.js"] = (function() {

    const exports = {};

    exports.BitSet = class BitSet { ... };

    return exports;

    }());

    modules["stats.js"] = (function() {

    const exports = {};

    const sum = (x, y) => x + y;

    const square = x = > x * x;

    exports.mean = function(data) { ... };

    exports.stddev = function(data) { ... };

    return exports;

    }());

writing code like the following to make use of those modules

    const stats = require("stats.js");

    const BitSet = require("sets.js").BitSet;

    // Now write code using those modules

    let s = new BitSet(100);

    s.insert(10);

    s.insert(20);

    s.insert(30);

    let average = stats.mean([...s]);

### Modules in¬†ES6

ES6 adds import and export keywords to JavaScript and finally supports real modularity as a core language feature.

ES6 modularity is conceptually the same as Node modularity: each file is its own module, and constants, variables, functions, and classes defined within a file are private to that module unless they are explicitly exported.

### ES6 Exports

To export a constant, variable, function, or class from an ES6 module, simply add the keyword export before the declaration

    export const PI = Math.PI;

    export function degreesToRadians(d) { return d * PI / 180; }

    export class Circle {

    constructor(r) { this.r = r; }

    area() { return PI * this.r * this.r; }

    }

or:

    export { Circle, degreesToRadians, PI };

It is common to write modules that export only one value (typically a function or class), and in this case, we usually use export `default` instead of `export`

    export default class BitSet {

    // implementation omitted

    }

### ES6 Imports

    import BitSet from './bitset.js';

    import { mean, stddev } from "./stats.js";

When importing from a module that defines many exports, however, you can easily import everything with an import statement like this:

    import * as stats from "./stats.js";

With the wildcard import shown in the previous example, the importing module would use the imported `mean()` and` stddev()` functions through the stats object, invoking them as `stats.mean()` and `stats.stddev()`.

Note: not finished.

### The JavaScript Standard¬†Library

### The Set¬†Class

Sets are not ordered or indexed, and they do not allow duplicates.

    let s = new Set();

    let t = new Set([1, s]);

    let t = new Set(s);

    let unique = new Set("Mississippi");

The argument to the `Set()` constructor need not be an array: any iterable object (including other Set objects) is allowed.

The `add()` method takes a single argument; if you pass an array, it adds the array itself to the set, not the individual array elements. `add()` always returns the set it is invoked on, however, so if you want to add multiple values to a set, you can used chained method calls like.

it is very important to understand that set membership is based on strict equality checks, like the === operator performs.

The most important thing we do with sets is not to add and remove elements from them, but to check to see whether a specified value is a member of the set:

`let oneDigitPrimes = new Set([2,3,5,7]);`

`oneDigitPrimes.has(2)`

The Set class is iterable, which means that you can use a `for/of` loop to enumerate all of the elements of a set:

    let sum = 0;

    for(let p of oneDigitPrimes) {

    sum += p; // and add them up

    }

Because Set objects are iterable, you can convert them to arrays and argument lists with the¬†‚Ä¶ spread operator

`[...oneDigitPrimes]`

JavaScript Set class always remembers the order that elements were inserted in, and it always uses this order when you iterate a set: the first element inserted will be the first one iterated (assuming you haven‚Äôt deleted it first), and the most recently inserted element will be the last one iterated.

Set class also implements a `forEach()` method

    let product = 1;

    oneDigitPrimes.forEach(n => { product *= n; });

### The Map¬†Class

    let m = new Map();

    let n = new Map([["one", 1],["two", 2]]);

    let copy = new Map(n);

    let o = { x: 1, y: 2};

    let p = new Map(Object.entries(o));

map is a set of keys, each of which has an associated value. This is not quite the same as a set of key/value pairs.

use `has()` to check whether a map includes the specified key; use `delete()` to remove a key (and its associated value) from the map; use `clear()` to remove all key/value pairs from the map; and use the size property to find out how many keys a map contains.

`set()` method of Map can be chained.

Any JavaScript value can be used as a key or a value in a Map. This includes` null, undefined`, and `NaN`, as well as reference types like objects and arrays.

Map compares keys by identity, not by equality.

`let m = new Map();`

`m.set({}, 1);`

`m.set({}, 2);`

Map a different empty object to the number 2.

`m.get({})`

undefined:

`m.set(m, undefined);`

`m.has(m)`

true

`m.get(m)`

undefined

Iterate over map:

`let m = new Map([["x", 1], ["y", 2]]);`

`[...m]`

\[\[‚Äúx‚Äù, 1\], \[‚Äúy‚Äù, 2\]\]

`for(let [key, value] of m) {...}`

Map class iterates in insertion order

If you want to iterate just the keys or just the associated values of a map, use the `keys()` and `values()` methods: these return iterable objects that iterate keys and values, in insertion order. (The  
¬†`entries()` method returns an iterable object that iterates key/value pairs, but this is exactly the same as iterating the map directly.)

    [...m.keys()]

    [...m.values()]

    [...m.entries()]

Map objects can also be iterated using the `forEach()`

    m.forEach((value, key) => {...}

Note that the value parameter comes before the key parameter.

### WeakMap and¬†WeakSet

The `WeakMap `class is a variant (but not an actual subclass) of the Map class that does not prevent its key values from being garbage collected.

`WeakMap `keys must be objects or arrays; primitive values are not subject to garbage collection and cannot be used as keys.

WeakMap implements only the` get(), set(), has(),` and `delete()` methods. In particular, `WeakMap` is not iterable and does not define `keys(), values(),` or `forEach()`. If WeakMap was iterable, then its keys would be reachable and it wouldn‚Äôt be weak.

Similarly, WeakMap does not implement the size property because the `size` of a WeakMap could change at any time as objects are garbage collected

### Typed Arrays and Binary¬†Data

They differ from regular arrays in some very important ways

¬∑ The elements of a typed array are all numbers. Unlike regular JavaScript numbers, however, typed arrays allow you to specify the type (signed and unsigned integers and IEEE-754 floating point) and size (8 bits to 64 bits) of the numbers to be stored in the array.

¬∑ You must specify the length of a typed array when you create it, and that length can never change.

¬∑ The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.

    Int8Array()

    Uint8Array()

    Uint8ClampedArray()

    Int16Array()

    Uint32Array()

    Uint16Array()

    Int32Array()

    BigInt64Array()

    BigUint64Array()

    Float32Array()

    let bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);

    let matrix = new Float64Array(9);

    let sudoku = new Int8Array(81);

Initialize with values

    let white = Uint8ClampedArray.of(255, 255, 255, 0);

    let ints = Uint32Array.from(white);

one more way to create typed arrays that involves the `ArrayBuffer` type

    let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024*1024);

    buffer.byteLength

1024\*1024

Typed arrays are not true arrays, but they re-implement most array methods, so you can use them pretty much just like you‚Äôd use regular arrays:

`let ints = new Int16Array(10);`

10 short integers

`ints.fill(3).map(x=>x*x).join("")`

‚Äú9999999999‚Äù

Remember that typed arrays have fixed lengths, so the length property is read-only, and methods that change the length of the array (such as` push(), pop(), unshift(), shift(),` and `splice()`) are not implemented for typed arrays. Methods that alter the contents of an array without changing the length (such as `sort(), reverse()`, and `fill()`) are implemented.

### Determine Endianess and¬†DataView

    let littleEndian = new Int8Array(new Int32Array([1]).buffer)

    [0] === 1;

You can use the `DataView` class, which defines methods for reading and writing values from an `ArrayBuffer` with explicitly specified byte ordering. Refer to book for more examples.

### Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions

RegExp objects may be created with the `RegExp()` constructor, of course, but they are more often created using a special literal syntax.

    let pattern = /s$/;

‚Üê&gt;

    let pattern = new RegExp("s$");

Regular expressions can also have one or more flag characters that affect how they work

    let pattern = /s$/i;

i = case insensitive

Punctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions: `^ $ . * + ? = ! : | \ / ( ) [ ] { }. `Other punctuation characters, such as quotation marks and @, do not have special meaning and simply match themselves literally in a regular expression.

If you use the `RegExp()` constructor, keep in mind that any backslashes in your regular expression need to be doubled, since strings also use backslashes as an escape character.

**Character**

**Matches**

`[...]`

Any one character between the brackets.

`[^...]`

Any one character not between the brackets

`.`

Any character except newline or another Unicode line terminator. Or, if the `RegExp` uses the s flag, then a period matches any character, including line terminators.

`\w`

Any ASCII word character. Equivalent to \[a-zA-Z0-9\_\].

`\W`

Equivalent to \[^a-zA-Z0-9\_\]

`\s`

Any Unicode whitespace character.

`\S`

Any character that is not Unicode whitespace.

`\d`

Equivalent to \[0-9\].

`\D`

Equivalent to \[‚Å∞-9\].

`[\b]`

A literal backspace (special case).

`[\s\d]`

Any one whitespace character or digit

REPETITIONS

**Character**

**Meaning**

`{n,m}`

Match the previous item at least n times but no more than m times

`{n,}`

Match the previous item n or more times.

`{n}`

Match exactly n occurrences of the previous item.

`?`

Equivalent to {0,1}.

`+`

Equivalent to {1,}

\*

Equivalent to {0,}.

**Example**

**Description**

    let r = /\d{2,4}/;

Match between two and four digits

    r = /\w{3}\d?/;

Match exactly three word characters and an optional digit

    r = /\s+java\s+/;

Match ‚Äújava‚Äù with one or more spaces before and after

    r = /[^(]*/;

Match zero or more characters that are not open parens

If you want to match repetitions of more complicated expressions, you‚Äôll need to define a group with parentheses

Be careful when using the \* and¬†? repetition characters. Since these characters may match zero instances of whatever precedes them, they are allowed to match nothing.

### NON-GREEDY REPETITION

It is also possible to specify that repetition should be done in a non-greedy way. Simply follow the repetition character or characters with a question mark:¬†`??, +?, *?`, or even {1,5}?.

**String**

**Pattern**

**Match**

    "aaa"

    /a+/

    "aaa"

    "aaa"

    /a+?/

    "a"

Note that using non-greedy repetition may not always produce the results you expect. This is because regular expression pattern matching is done by findingthe first position in the string at which a match is possible. Since a match is possible starting at the first character of the string, shorter matches starting at subsequent characters are never even considered.

### ALTERNATION, GROUPING, AND REFERENCES

**Char**

**Pattern**

**Pattern**

`|`

`/ab|cd|ef/`

‚Äúab‚Äù or the string ‚Äúcd‚Äù or the string ‚Äúef‚Äù.

`/\d{3}|[a-z]{4}/`

either three digits or four lowercase letters.

`/a|ab/`

matches only the first letter ‚Äúa‚Äù

`()`

`/java(script)?/`

matches ‚Äújava‚Äù followed by the optional ‚Äúscript‚Äù

`/(ab|cd)+|ef/`

matches ‚Äújava‚Äù followed by the optional ‚Äúscript‚Äù

If the left alternative matches, the right alternative is ignored, even if it would have produced a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù match

Another purpose of parentheses in regular expressions is to define subpatterns within the complete pattern. When a regular expression is successfully matched against a target string, it is possible to extract the portions of the target string that matched any particular parenthesized subpattern. For example, suppose you are looking for one or more lowercase letters followed by one or more digits. You might use the pattern `/[a-z]+\d+/`. But suppose you only really care about the digits at the end of each match. If you put that part of the pattern in parentheses (/\[a-z\]+(\\d+)/), you can extract the digits from any matches you find,

A related use of parenthesized subexpressions is to allow you to refer back to a subexpression later in the same regular expression. This is done by following a \\ character by a digit or digits. The digits refer to the position of the parenthesized subexpression within the regular expression. For example, \\1 refers back to the first subexpression, and \\3 refers to the third.

**Match**

**Pattern**

zero or more characters within single or double quotes. However, it does not  
¬†require the opening and closing quotes to match

    /['"][^'"]*['"]/

To require the quotes to match,use a reference

    /(['"])[^'"]*\1/

**Character**

**Meaning**

|

match either the subexpression to the left or the subexpression to the right.

(‚Ä¶)

Grouping: group items into a single unit that can be used with \*, +,¬†?, |, and so on. Also remember the characters that match this group for use with later references

(?:‚Ä¶)

group items into a single unit, but do not remember the characters that match this group.

Note` (?:...)` syntax:

In pattern` "/([Jj]ava(?:[Ss]cript)?)\sis\s(fun\w*)/`‚Äù `\2` refers to the text matched by `(fun\w*)` since `(?:[Ss]cript)?)` in not remembered.

### SPECIFYING MATCH¬†POSITION

_regular expression anchors_ because they anchor the pattern to a specific position in the search string. The most commonly used anchor elements are ^, which ties the pattern to the beginning of the string, and $, which anchors the pattern to the end of the string.

**Example**

**Pattern**

match the word ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù on a line by itself

`/^JavaScript$/`

To search for ‚ÄúJava‚Äù as a word by itself you can try the pattern `/\sJava\s/`, which requires a space before and after the word. But there are two problems with this solution. First, it does not match ‚ÄúJava‚Äù at the beginning or the end of a string, but only if it appears with space on either side. Second, when this pattern does find a match, the matched string it returns has leading and trailing spaces, which is not quite what‚Äôs needed. So instead of matching actual space characters with \\s, match (or anchor to) word boundaries with \\b. The resulting expression is `/\bJava\b/`.

The element `\B` anchors the match to a location that is not a word boundary. Thus, the pattern `/\B[Ss]cript/` matches ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù and ‚Äúpostscript‚Äù, but not ‚Äúscript‚Äù or ‚ÄúScripting‚Äù.

You can also use arbitrary regular expressions as anchor conditions.

If you include an expression within `(?= and )` characters, it is a lookahead assertion, and it specifies that the enclosed characters must match, without actually matching them.

**Example**

**Pattern**

**Matches**

to match the name of a common programming language, but only if it is followed by a colon

`/[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?(?=\:)/`

matches the word ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù in ‚ÄúJavaScript: The DefinitiveGuide‚Äù

does not match ‚ÄúJava‚Äù in ‚ÄúJava in a Nutshell‚Äù

If you instead introduce an assertion with `(?!`, it is a negative lookahead assertion.

### FLAGS

Flags are specified after the second / character of a regular expression literal or as a string passed as the second argument to the RegExp() constructor.

**Flag**

**Meaning**

g

‚Äúglobal‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat is,that we intend to use it to find all matches within a string rather than just finding the first [match.it](http://match.it/) does alter the behavior of the String `match()` method and the `RegExp exec()` method in important ways.

i

case-insensitive

m

‚Äúmultiline‚Äù mode

s

useful when working with text that includes newlines.Normally, a ‚Äú.‚Äù in a regular expression matches any character except a line terminator. When the s flag is used, however, ‚Äú.‚Äù will match any character, including line terminators.

u

Unicode.

Setting the u flag on a RegExp also allows you to use the new `\u{...}` escape sequence for Unicode character and also enables the \\p{‚Ä¶} notation for Unicode character classes.

y

‚Äústicky‚Äù. should match at the beginning of a string or at the first character following the previous match

### String Methods for Pattern¬†Matching

### SEARCH()

Strings support four methods that use regular expressions.

`"JavaScript".search(/script/ui)`

4

`"Python".search(/script/ui)`

-1

`search()` does not support global searches; it ignores the `g` flag of its regular expression argument.

REPLACE()

`text.replace(/javascript/gi, "JavaScript");`

No matter how it is capitalized, replace it with the correct capitalization

parenthesized subexpressions of a regular expression are numbered from left to right and that the regular expression remembers the text that each subexpression matches.

to replace quotation marks in a string with other characters:

`let quote = /"([^"]*)"/g;`

`'He said "stop"'.replace(quote, '¬´$1¬ª')`

‚ÄòHe said ¬´stop¬ª‚Äô

If your RegExp uses named capture groups, then you can refer to the matching text by name rather than by number:

`let quote = /"(?<quotedText>[^"]*)"/g;`

`'He said "stop"'.replace(quote, '¬´$<quotedText>¬ª')`

‚ÄòHe said ¬´stop¬ª‚Äô

Instead of passing a replacement string as the second argument to replace(), you can also pass a function that will be invoked to compute the replacement value.

Example to convert decimal integers in a string to hexadecimal:

`let s = "15 times 15 is 225";`

`s.replace(/\d+/gu, n => parseInt(n).toString(16))`

‚Äúf times f is e1‚Äù

### MATCH()

`"7 plus 8 equals 15".match(/\d+/g)`

\[‚Äú7‚Äù, ‚Äú8‚Äù, ‚Äú15‚Äù\]

If the regular expression does not have the `g` flag set, `match()` does not do a global search; it simply searches for the first match. In this nonglobal case, `match()` still returns an array, but the array elements are completely different.

Thus, if `match()` returns an array a, a\[0\] contains the complete match, a\[1\] contains the substring that matched the first parenthesized expression, and so on.

    let url = /(\w+):\/\/([\w.]+)\/(\S*)/;

    let text = "Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david";

    let match = text.match(url);

    let fullurl, protocol, host, path;

    if (match !== null) {

    fullurl = match[0];

[‚Äúhttp://www.example.com/~david](http://www.example.com/~david)‚Äú

    protocol = match[1];

‚Äúhttp‚Äù

    host = match[2];

[‚Äúwww.example.com](http://www.example.com/)‚Äú

    path = match[3];

‚Äú~david‚Äù

In this non-global case, the array returned by match() also has some object properties in addition to the numbered array elements.

input property refers to the string on which match() was called

The index property is the position within that string at which the match starts.

if the regular expression contains named capture groups, then the returned array also has a groups property whose value is an object.

`let url = /(?<protocol>\w+):\/\/(?<host>[\w.]+)\/(?<path>\S*)/;`

`let text = "Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david";`

`let match = text.match(url);`

`match[0]`

[‚Äúhttp://www.example.com/~david](http://www.example.com/~david)‚Äú

`match.input`

text

`match.index`

17

`match.groups.protocol`

‚Äúhttp‚Äù

`match.groups.host`

[‚Äúwww.example.com](http://www.example.com/)‚Äú

`match.groups.path`

‚Äú~david‚Äù

There are also important but less dramatic differences in behavior when the y flag is set. Refer to book for examples.

### MATCHALL()

Instead of returning an array of matching substrings like `match()` does, however, it returns an iterator that yields the kind of match objects that match() returns when used with a non-global RegExp.

### SPLIT()

`"123,456,789".split(",")`

\[‚Äú123‚Äù, ‚Äú456‚Äù,‚Äù789‚Ä≥\]

`"1, 2, 3,\n4, 5".split(/\s*,\s*/)`

\[‚Äú1‚Äù, ‚Äú2‚Äù, ‚Äú3‚Äù, ‚Äú4‚Äù,‚Äù5‚Ä≥\]

Surprisingly, if you call `split()` with a RegExp delimiter and the regular expression includes capturing groups, then the text that matches the capturing groups will be included in the returned array.

`const htmlTag = /<([^>]+)>/;`

`"Testing<br/>1,2,3".split(htmlTag)`

\[‚ÄúTesting‚Äù, ‚Äúbr/‚Äù,‚Äù1,2,3‚Ä≥\]

### The RegExp¬†Class

The `RegExp()` constructor is useful when a regular expression is being dynamically created and thus cannot be represented with the regular expression literal syntax.

    let zipcode = new RegExp("\\d{5}", "g");

`let exactMatch = /JavaScript/;`  
¬†`let caseInsensitive = new RegExp(exactMatch, "i");`

### TEST()

Returns true or false by calling `exec()`.

### EXEC()

    let pattern = /Java/g;

    let text = "JavaScript > Java";

    let match;

    while((match = pattern.exec(text)) !== null) {

    console.log(`Matched ${match[0]} at ${match.index}`);

    console.log(`Next search begins at ${pattern.lastIndex}`);

    }

### THE LASTINDEX PROPERTY AND REGEXP¬†REUSE

The use of the `lastIndex` property with the g and y flags is a particularly awkward part of this API. When you use these flags, you need to be particularly careful when calling the `match(), exec()`, or `test()` methods because the behavior of these methods depends on `lastIndex`, and the value of `lastIndex` depends on what you have previously done with the RegExp object.

To find the index of all &lt;p&gt; tags within a string of HTML text:

    let match, positions = [];

    while((match = /<p>/g.exec(html)) !== null) {

    positions.push(match.index);

    }

If the html string contains at least one &lt;p&gt; tag, then it will loop forever. For each iteration of the loop, we‚Äôre creating a new RegExp object with `lastIndex` set to 0, so `exec()` always begins at the start of the string, and if there is a match, it will keep matching over and over. The solution, of course, is to define the RegExp once, and save it to a variable so that we‚Äôre using the same RegExp object for each iteration of the loop.

On the other hand, sometimes reusing a RegExp object is the wrong thing to do. Suppose, for example, that we want to loop through all of the words in a dictionary to find words that contain pairs of double letters.

    let dictionary = [ "apple", "book", "coffee" ];

    let doubleLetterWords = [];

    let doubleLetter = /(\w)\1/g;

    for(let word of dictionary) {

    if (doubleLetter.test(word)) {

    doubleLetterWords.push(word);

    }

    }

`doubleLetterWords`

\[‚Äúapple‚Äù, ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù\]: ‚Äúbook‚Äù is missing!

Because we set the g flag on the RegExp, the `lastIndex` property is changed after successful matches, and the `test()` method (which is based on `exec()`) starts searching for a match at the position specified by `lastIndex`. After matching the ‚Äúpp‚Äù in ‚Äúapple‚Äù, `lastIndex` is 3, and so we start searching the word ‚Äúbook‚Äù at position 3 and do not see the ‚Äúoo‚Äù that it contains.

### Dates and¬†Times

    let now = new Date();

The current time

    let epoch = new Date(0);

Midnight, January 1st, 1970, GMT

    let century = new Date(2100,

    0,

    1,

    2, 3, 4, 5);

Year 2100

January

1st

02:03:04.005, local

    let century = new Date(Date.UTC(2100, 0, 1));

Midnight in GMT, January 1, 2100

If you print a date (with console.log(century), for example), it will, by default, be printed in your local time zone. If you want to display a date in UTC, you should explicitly convert it to a string with `toUTCString()` or` toISOString()`.

if you pass a string to the Date() constructor, it will attempt to parse that string as a date and time specification

`let century = new Date("2100-01-01T00:00:00Z");`

Once you have a Date object, various get and set methods allow you to query and modify the year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond fields of the Date. Each of these methods hastwo forms: one that gets or sets using local time and one that gets or sets using UTC time.

Note that the methods for querying the day-of-month are `getDate()` and `getUTCDate()`. The more natural-sounding functions `getDay()` and `getUTCDay()` return the day-of-week (0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday). The day-of-week is read-only, so there is not a corresponding `setDay()` method.

### Timestamps

JavaScript represents dates internally as integers that specify the number of milliseconds since (or before) midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC time.

For any Date object, the `getTime()` method returns this internal value, and the `setTime()` method sets it.

    d.setTime(d.getTime() + 30000);

add 30 secs

The static Date.now() method returns the current time as a timestamp and is helpful when you want to measure how long your code takes to run

    let startTime = Date.now();

    reticulateSplines(); // Do some time-consuming operation

    let endTime = Date.now();

    console.log(`Spline reticulation took ${endTime -startTime}ms.`);

adds three months and two weeks to the current date:

`let d = new Date();`  
¬†`d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3, d.getDate() + 14);`

### Formatting and Parsing Date¬†Strings

    let d = new Date(2020, 0, 1, 17, 10, 30);

    d.toString()

‚ÄúWed Jan 01 2020 17:10:30 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)‚Äù

    d.toUTCString()

‚ÄúThu, 02 Jan 2020 01:10:30 GMT‚Äù

    d.toLocaleDateString()

‚Äú1/1/2020‚Äù: ‚Äòen-US‚Äô locale

    d.toLocaleTimeString()

‚Äú5:10:30 PM‚Äù: ‚Äòen-US‚Äô locale

    d.toISOString()

‚Äú2020-01-02T01:10:30.000Z‚Äù

there is also a static Date.parse() method that takes a string as its argument, attempts to parse it as a date and time, and returns a timestamp representing that date. `Date.parse()` is able to parse the same strings that the `Date()` constructor can and is guaranteed to be able to parse the output of` toISOString(), toUTCString()`, and` toString()`.

### Error Classes

One good reason to use an Error object is that, when you create an Error, it captures the state of the JavaScript stack, and if the exception is uncaught, the stack trace will be displayed with the error message, which will help you debug the issue.

Error objects have two properties: `message` and `name`, and a` toString()` method. Node and all modern browsers also define a `stack` property on Error objects.

Subclasses are `EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError,` and `URIError`.

You should feel free to define your own Error subclasses that best encapsulate the error conditions of your own program.

    class HTTPError extends Error {

    constructor(status, statusText, url) {

    super(`${status} ${statusText}: ${url}`);

    this.status = status;

    this.statusText = statusText;

    this.url = url;

    }

    get name() { return "HTTPError"; }

    }

    let error = new HTTPError(404, "Not Found", "http://example.com/");

    error.status

404

    error.message

‚Äú404 Not Found:<http://example.com/>‚Äú

    error.name

HTTPError

### JSON Serialization and¬†Parsing

JavaScript supports JSON serialization and deserialization with the two functions `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse().`

    let o = {s: "", n: 0, a: [true, false, null]};

    let s = JSON.stringify(o);

s == ‚Äò{‚Äús‚Äù:‚Äù‚Äù,‚Äùn‚Äù:0,‚Äùa‚Äù:\[true,false,null\]}‚Äô

    let copy = JSON.parse(s);

copy == {s: ‚Äú‚Äù, n: 0, a:\[true, false, null\]}

Inefficient way of creating a deep copy of an object

    function deepcopy(o) {

    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));

    }

Typically, you pass only a single argument to `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`. Both functions accept an optional second argument that allows us to extend the JSON format.

`JSON.stringify()` also takes an optional third argument. If you would like your JSONformatted string to be human-readable (if it is being used as a configuration file, for example), then you should pass null as the second argument and pass a number or string as the third argument. If the third argument is a number, then it will use that number of spaces for each indentation level. If the third argument is a string of whitespace (such as ‚Äò\\t‚Äô), it will use that string for each level of indent.

### JSON Customizations

If `JSON.stringify()` is asked to serialize a value that is not natively supported by the JSON format, it looks to see if that value has a `toJSON()` method, and if so, it calls that method and then stringifies the return value in place of the original value. Date objects implement `toJSON()`: it returns the same string that `toISOString()` method does.

If you need to re-create Date objects (or modify the parsed object inany other way), you can pass a ‚Äúreviver‚Äù function as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`.

    let data = JSON.parse(text, function(key, value) {

    if (key[0] === "_") return undefined;

    if (typeof value === "string" && /^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d\d\dZ$/.test(value)) {

    return new Date(value);

    }

    return value;

    });

### The Console¬†API

Console functions that print their arguments like console.log() have a little-known feature: if the first argument is a string that includes `%s, %i, %d, %f, %o, %O, or %c`, then this first argument is treated as format string, and the values of subsequent arguments are substituted into the string in place of the two-character % sequences.

### URL API

    let url = new URL("https://example.com:8000/path/name?q=term#fragment");

    url.href

[‚Äúhttps://example.com:8000/path/name](https://example.com:8000/path/name)?q=term\#fragment‚Äù

    url.origin

[‚Äúhttps://example.com:8000](https://example.com:8000/)‚Äú

    url.protocol

‚Äúhttps:‚Äù

    url.host

[‚Äúexample.com](http://example.com/):8000‚Äù

    url.hostname

[‚Äúexample.com](http://example.com/)‚Äù

    url.port

‚Äú8000‚Äù

    url.pathname

‚Äú/path/name‚Äù

    url.search

‚Äú?q=term‚Äù

    url.hash

‚Äú\#fragment‚Äù

    let url = new URL("https://example.com");

    url.pathname = "api/search";

Add a path to an API endpoint

    url.search = "q=test";

Add a query parameter

    url.toString()

[‚Äúhttps://example.com/api/search?q=test](https://example.com/api/search?q=test)‚Äú

One of the important features of the URL class is that it correctly adds punctuation and escapes special characters in URLs when that is needed

    let url = new URL("https://example.com");

    url.pathname = "path with spaces";

    url.pathname

‚Äú/path%20with%20spaces‚Äù

    url.search = "q=foo#bar";

    url.search

‚Äú?q=foo%23bar‚Äù

    url.href

[‚Äúhttps://example.com/path%20with%20spaces?q=foo%23bar](https://example.com/path%20with%20spaces?q=foo%23bar)‚Äú

Often, however, HTTP requests encode the values of multiple form fields or multiple API parameters into the query portion of a URL. In this format, the query portion of the URL is a question mark followed by one or more name/value pairs, which are separated from one another by ampersands.

If you want to encode these kinds of name/value pairs into the query portion of a URL, then the searchParams property will be more useful than the search property.

`let url = new URL("https://example.com/search");`

`url.search`

‚Äú‚Äù

`url.searchParams.append("q", "term");`

`url.search`

‚Äú?q=term‚Äù

`url.searchParams.set("q", "x");`

`url.search`

‚Äú?q=x‚Äù

`url.searchParams.append("opts", "1");`

`url.search`

‚Äú?q=x&opts=1‚Äù

The value of the searchParams property is a URLSearchParams object.

`let url = new URL("http://example.com");`

`let params = new URLSearchParams();`

`params.append("q", "term");`

`params.append("opts", "exact");`

`params.toString()`

‚Äúq=term&opts=exact‚Äù

`url.search = params;`

`url.href`

[‚Äúhttp://example.com/](http://example.com/)?q=term&opts=exact‚Äù

### Timers

`setTimeout()` and` setInterval()`‚Äîthat allow programs to ask the browser to invoke a function after a specified amount of time has elapsed or to invoke the function repeatedly at a specified interval.

    setTimeout(() => { console.log("Ready..."); }, 1000);

    setTimeout(() => { console.log("set..."); }, 2000);

    setTimeout(() => { console.log("go!"); }, 3000);

If you want to invoke a function repeatedly, use `setInterval()`

Both `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` return a value. If you save this value in a variable, you can then use it later to cancel the execution of the function by passing it to `clearTimeout()` or `clearInterval()`.

    let clock = setInterval(() => {

    console.clear();

    console.log(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());

    }, 1000);

    setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(clock); }, 10000);

After 10 seconds: stop the repeating code above

### Iterators and Generators

The iterator method of an iterable object does not have a conventional name but uses the Symbol, Symbol.iterator as its name. So a simple for/of loop over an iterable object iterable could also be written the hard way, like this:

    let iterable = [99];

    let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();

    for(let result = iterator.next(); !result.done; result =iterator.next()) {

    console.log(result.value) // result.value == 99

    }

When you want to iterate though a ‚Äúpartially used‚Äù iterator:

`let list = [1,2,3,4,5];`  
¬†`let iter = list[Symbol.iterator]();`

`let head = iter.next().value;`

head == 1

`let tail = [...iter];`

tail == \[2,3,4,5\]

### Implementing Iterable¬†Objects

we will implement the Range class one more time, making it iterable without relying on a generator.

In order to make a class iterable, you must implement a method whose name is the Symbol `Symbol.iterator`

    class Range {

    constructor (from, to) {

    this.from = from;

    this.to = to;

    }

    has(x) { return typeof x === "number" && this.from <= x && x <= this.to; }

    toString() { return `{ x | ${this.from} ‚â§ x ‚â§ ${this.to}}`; }

    [Symbol.iterator]() {

    let next = Math.ceil(this.from);

    let last = this.to;

    return {

    next() {

    return (next <= last) ? { value: next++ } : { done: true };

    },

    [Symbol.iterator]() { return this; }

    };

    }

    }

    for(let x of new Range(1,10)) console.log(x);

Logs numbers 1 to 10

    [...new Range(-2,2)]

\[-2, -1, 0,1, 2\]

In addition to making your classes iterable, it can be quite useful to define functions that return iterable values.

Return an iterable object that iterates the result of applying `f()` to each value from the source iterable

    function map(iterable, f) {

    let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();

    return {

    [Symbol.iterator]() { return this; },

    next() {

    let v = iterator.next();

    if (v.done) {

    return v;

    }

    else {

    return { value: f(v.value) };

    }

    }

    };

    }

`[...map(new Range(1,4), x => x*x)]`

\[1, 4, 9, 16\]

Return an iterable object that filters the specified iterable, iterating only those elements for which the predicate returns true

    function filter(iterable, predicate) {

    let iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();

    return {

    [Symbol.iterator]() { return this; },

    next() {

    for(;;) {

    let v = iterator.next();

    if (v.done || predicate(v.value)) {

    return v;

    }

    }

    }

    };

    }

`[...filter(new Range(1,10), x => x % 2 === 0)]`

\[2,4,6,8,10\]

### Generators

Particularly useful when the values to be iterated are not the elements of a data structure, but the result of a computation.

To create a generator, you must first define a generator function‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädefined with the keyword `function*` rather than `function`

When you invoke a generator function, it does not actually execute the function body, but instead returns a generator object. This generator object is an iterator.

Calling its `next()` method causes the body of the generator function to run from the start (or whatever its current position is) until it reaches a `yield` statement.

The value of the `yield` statement becomes the value returned by the `next()` call on the iterator.

    function* oneDigitPrimes() {

    yield 2;

    yield 3;

    yield 5;

    yield 7;

    }

    let primes = oneDigitPrimes();

we get a generator

    primes.next().value

2

    primes.next().value

3

    primes.next().value

5

    primes.next().value

7

    primes.next().done

true

Generators have a `Symbol.iterator` method to make them iterable

`primes[Symbol.iterator]()`

`[...oneDigitPrimes()]`

\[2,3,5,7\]

    let sum = 0;

    for(let prime of oneDigitPrimes()) sum += prime;

    sum

17

Like regular functions, however, we can also define generators in expression form.

    const seq = function*(from,to) {

    for(let i = from; i <= to; i++) yield i;

    };

    [...seq(3,5)]

\[3, 4, 5\]

In classes and object literals, we can use shorthand notation to omit the function keyword entirely when we define methods.

    let o = {

    x: 1, y: 2, z: 3,

    *g() {

    for(let key of Object.keys(this)) {

    yield key;

    }

    }

    };

`[...o.g()]`

\[‚Äúx‚Äù, ‚Äúy‚Äù, ‚Äúz‚Äù, ‚Äúg‚Äù\]

Generators often make it particularly easy to define iterable classes.

    *[Symbol.iterator]() {

    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)

    yield x;

    }

### Generator Examples

Generators are more interesting if they actually generate the values they yield by doing some kind of computation.

generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers

    function* fibonacciSequence() {

    let x = 0, y = 1;

    for(;;) {

    yield y;

    [x, y] = [y, x+y];

    }

    }

If this generator is used with the¬†‚Ä¶ spread operator, it will loop until memory is exhausted and the program crashes.

Use it in a `for/of` loop, however

    function fibonacci(n) {

    for(let f of fibonacciSequence()) {

    if (n-- <= 0) return f;

    }

    }

    fibonacci(20)

This kind of infinite generator becomes more useful with a `take()` generator like this

    function* take(n, iterable) {

    let it = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();

    while(n-- > 0) {

    let next = it.next();

    if (next.done) return;

    else yield next.value;

    }

    }

    [...take(5, fibonacciSequence())]

### Asynchronous Javascript

`Promises`, new in ES6, are objects that represent the not-yet-available result of an asynchronous operation.

The keywords `async` and `await` were introduced in ES2017 and provide new syntax that simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing you to structure your Promise based code as if it was synchronous.

Asynchronous iterators and the` for/await` loop were introduced in ES2018 and allow you to work with streams of asynchronous events using simple loops that appear synchronous.

### Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks

### Timers

`setTimeout(checkForUpdates, 60000);`

    let updateIntervalId = setInterval(checkForUpdates, 60000);

    function stopCheckingForUpdates() {

    clearInterval(updateIntervalId);

    }

### Events

Event-driven JavaScript programs register callback functions for specified types of events in specified contexts, and the web browser invokes those functions whenever the specified events occur.

These callback functions are called event handlers or event listeners, and they are registered with `addEventListener()`

Ask the web browser to return an object representing the HTML &lt;button&gt; element that matches this CSS selector:

`let okay = document.querySelector('#confirmUpdateDialogbutton.okay');`

Now register a callback function to be invoked when the user clicks on that button

`okay.addEventListener('click', applyUpdate);`

### Network Events

JavaScript running in the browser can fetch data from a web server with code like this:

    function getCurrentVersionNumber(versionCallback) {

    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();

    request.open("GET", "http://www.example.com/api/version");

    request.send();

    request.onload = function() {

    if (request.status === 200) {

    let currentVersion = parseFloat(request.responseText);

    versionCallback(null, currentVersion);

    }

    else {

    versionCallback(response.statusText, null);

    }

    };

    request.onerror = request.ontimeout = function(e) {

    versionCallback(e.type, null);

    };

    }

### Promises

Promises, a core language feature designed to simplify asynchronous programming.

A Promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. That result may or may not be ready yet, and the Promise API is intentionally vague about this: there is no way to synchronously get the value of a Promise; you can only ask the Promise to call a callback function when the value is ready.

One real problem with callback-based asynchronous programming is that it is common to end up with callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, with lines of code so highly indented that it is difficult to read.

Promises allow this kind of nested callback to be re-expressed as a more linear Promise chain that tends to be easier to read and easier to reason about.

Another problem with callbacks is that they can make handling errors difficult. If an asynchronous function (or an asynchronously invoked callback) throws an exception, there is no way for that exception to propagate back to the initiator of the asynchronous operation. This is a fundamental fact about asynchronous programming: it breaks exception handling. Promises help here by standardizing a way to handle errors and providing a way for errors to propagate correctly through a chain of promises.

Note that Promises represent the future results of single asynchronous computations. They cannot be used to represent repeated asynchronous computations, however.

We can‚Äôt use Promises to replace `setInterval()` because that function invokes a callback function repeatedly, which is something that Promises are just not designed to do.

### Using Promises

How we would use this Promise returning utility function

    getJSON(url).then(jsonData => {

    // callback function that will be asynchronously invoked with the parsed JSON value when it becomes available.

    });

The Promise object defines a then() instance method. Instead of passing our callback function directly to `getJSON()`, we instead pass it to the then() method. When the HTTP response arrives, the body of that response is parsed as JSON, and the resulting parsed value is passed to the function that we passed to `then()`.

If you call the `then()` method of a Promise object multiple times, each of the functions you specify will be called when the promised computation is complete.

Unlike many event listeners, though, a Promise represents a single computation, and each function registered with then() will be invoked only once.

    function displayUserProfile(profile) { ...}

    getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile);

### HANDLING ERRORS WITH¬†PROMISES

Asynchronous operations, particularly those that involve networking, can typically fail in a number of ways, and robust code has to be written to handle the errors that will inevitably occur.

`getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile, handleProfileError);`

if `getJSON()` runs normally, it passes its result to `displayUserProfile()`. If there is an error (the user is not logged in, the server is down, the user‚Äôs internet connection dropped, the request timed out, etc.), then `getJSON()` passes an Error object to `handleProfileError()`.

In practice, it is rare to see two functions passed to then(). There is a better and more idiomatic way of handling errors when working with Promises.

To understand it, first consider what happens if `getJSON()` completes normally but an error occurs in `displayUserProfile()`. That callback function is invoked asynchronously when `getJSON()` returns, so it is also asynchronous and cannot meaningfully throw an exception (because there is no code on the call stack to handle it).

    getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile).catch(handleProfileError);

With this code, a normal result from` getJSON()` is still passed to `displayUserProfile()`, but any error in `getJSON()` or in `displayUserProfile()` (including any exceptions thrown by `displayUserProfile`) get passed to `handleProfileError()`.

### Chaining Promises

One of the most important benefits of Promises is that they provide a natural way to express a sequence of asynchronous operations as a linear chain of `then()` method invocations, without having to nest each operation within the callback of the previous one.

    fetch(documentURL)

    .then(response => response.json())

    .then(document => {return render(document); })

    .then(rendered => {cacheInDatabase(rendered); })

    .catch(error => handle(error));

has largely been replaced by the newer, Promise-based Fetch API. In its simplest form, this new HTTP API is just the function fetch(). That promise is fulfilled when the HTTP response begins to arrive and the HTTP status and headers are available.

    fetch("/api/user/profile")

    .then(response => {

    if (response.ok &&  response.headers.get("Content-Type") === "application/json") {

    // What can we do here? We don't actually have the response body yet.

    }

    });

But although the initial Promise is fulfilled, the body of the response may not yet have arrived. So these `text()` and` json()` methods for accessing the body of the response themselves return Promises.

    fetch("/api/user/profile")

    .then(response => {

    return response.json();

    })

    .then(profile => {

    displayUserProfile(profile);

    });

There is a second `then()` in the chain, which means that the first invocation of the `then()` method must itself return a Promise. That is not how Promises work, however.

When we write a chain of¬†`.then()` invocations, we are not registering multiple callbacks on a single Promise object. Instead, each invocation of the `then()` method returns a new Promise object. That new Promise object is not fulfilled until the function passed to `then()` is complete.

    fetch(theURL)       // task 1; returns promise 1

    .then(callback1)  // task 2; returns promise 2

    .then(callback2); // task 3; returns promise 3

### Resolving Promises

There is actually a fourth Promise object involved as which brings up the point of what it means for a Promise to be ‚Äúresolved.‚Äù

fetch() returns a Promise object which, when fulfilled, passes a Response object to the callback function we register. This Response object has¬†`.text(), .json(),` and other methods to request the body of the HTTP response in various forms. But since the body may not yet have arrived, these methods must return Promise objects.

‚Äútask 2‚Äù calls the¬†`.json()` method and returns its value. This is the fourth Promise object, and it is the return value of the `callback1()` function.

Let‚Äôs consider:

    function c1(response) {

    let p4 = response.json();

    return p4;

    }

    // callback 1

    // returns promise 4

    function c2(profile) {

    displayUserProfile(profile);

    }

    // callback 2

    let p1 = fetch("/api/user/profile");

    promise 1, task 1

    let p2 = p1.then(c1);

    promise 2, task 2

    let p3 = p2.then(c2);

    promise 3, task 3

In order for Promise chains to work usefully, the output of task 2 must become the input to task 3. The input to task 3 is the body of the URL that was fetched, parsed as a JSON object. But the return value of callback c1 is not a JSON object, but Promise p4 for that JSON object.

When p1 is fulfilled, c1 is invoked, and task 2 begins. And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins.

And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins. But just because task 2 begins when c1 is invoked,it does not mean that task 2 must end when c1 returns.

Promises are about managing asynchronous tasks, and if task 2 is asynchronous, then that task will not be complete by the time the callback returns.

When you pass a callback c to the `then()` method, `then()` returns a Promise p and arranges to asynchronously invoke c at some later time. The callback performs some computation and returns a value v. When the callback returns, p is resolved with the value v. When a Promise is resolved with a value that is not itself a Promise, it is immediately fulfilled with that value.

So if c returns a non-Promise, that return value becomes the value of p, p is fulfilled and we are done. But if the return value v is itself a Promise, then p is resolved but not yet fulfilled.

At this stage, p cannot settle until the Promise v settles. If v is fulfilled, then p will be fulfilled to the same value. If v is rejected, then p will be rejected for the same reason. This is what the ‚Äúresolved‚Äù state of a Promise means

the Promise has become associated with, or ‚Äúlocked onto,‚Äù another Promise. We don‚Äôt know yet whether p will be fulfilled or rejected, but our callback c no longer has any control over that. p is ‚Äúresolved‚Äù in the sense that its fate now depends entirely on what happens to Promise v.

Let‚Äôs bring this back to our URL-fetching example. When c1 returns p4, p2 is resolved. But being resolved is not the same as being fulfilled, so task 3 does not begin yet. When the full body of the HTTP response becomes available, then the¬†.`json()` method can parse it and use that parsed value to fulfill p4. When p4 is fulfilled, p2 is automatically fulfilled as well, with the same parsed JSON value. At this point, the parsed JSON object is passed to c2, and task 3 begins.

### More on Promises and¬†Errors

With synchronous code, if you leave out error-handling code, you‚Äôll at least get an exception and a stack trace that you can use to figure out what is going wrong. With asynchronous code, unhandled exceptions will often go unreported, and errors can occur silently, making them much harder to debug. The good news is that the¬†`.catch()` method makes it easy to handle errors when working with Promises.

THE CATCH AND FINALLY METHODS

The¬†`.catch()` method of a Promise is simply a shorthand way to call¬†`.then()` with null as the first argument and an error-handling callback as the second argument.

Normal exceptions don‚Äôt work with asynchronous code. The¬†`.catch()` method of Promises is an alternative that does work for asynchronous code.

    fetch("/api/user/profile")

    .then(response => {

    if (!response.ok) {

    return null;

    }

    let type = response.headers.get("content-type");

    if (type !== "application/json") {

    throw new TypeError(`Expected JSON, got ${type}`);

    }

    return response.json();

    })

    .then(profile => {

    if (profile) {

    displayUserProfile(profile);

    }

    else {

    displayLoggedOutProfilePage();

    }

    })

    .catch(e => {

    if (e instanceof NetworkError) {

    displayErrorMessage("Check your internet connection.");

    }

    else if (e instanceof TypeError) {

    displayErrorMessage("Something is wrong with our server!");

    }

    else {

    console.error(e);

    }

    });

p1 is the Promise returned by the `fetch()` call

p2 is the Promise returned by the first¬†`.then()` call

c1 is the callback that we pass to that¬†.`then()` call

p3 is the Promise returned by the second¬†`.then()` call

c2 is the callback we pass to that call

c3 is the callback that we pass to the¬†`.catch()` call

The first thing that could fail is the fetch() request itself. Let‚Äôs say p1 was rejected with a NetworkError object.

We didn‚Äôt pass an error-handling callback function as the second argument to the¬†`.then()` call, so p2 rejects as well with the same NetworkError object.

Without a handler, though, p2 is rejected, and then p3 is rejected for the same reason.

At this point, the c3 error-handling callback is called, and the NetworkError-specific code within it runs.

There are a couple of things worth noting about this code. First, notice that the error object thrown with a regular, synchronous throw statement ends up being handled asynchronously with a¬†`.catch()` method invocation in a Promise chain. This should make it clear why this shorthand method is preferred over passing a second argument to¬†.`then()`, and also why it is so idiomatic to end Promise chains with a¬†`.catch()` call.

it is also perfectly valid to use¬†`.catch()` elsewhere in a Promise chain. If one of the stages in your Promise chain can fail with an error, and if the error is some kind of recoverable error that should not stop the rest of the chain from running, then you can insert a¬†`.catch()` call in the chain, resulting in code that might look like this:

    startAsyncOperation()

    .then(doStageTwo)

    .catch(recoverFromStageTwoError)

    .then(doStageThree)

    .then(doStageFour)

    .catch(logStageThreeAndFourErrors);

If the callback returns normally, then the¬†`.catch()` callback will be skipped, and the return value of the previous callback will become the input to the next¬†.`then()` callback.

Once an error has been passed to a¬†`.catch()` callback, it stops propagating down the Promise chain. A¬†`.catch()` callback can throw a new error, but if it returns normally, than that return value is used to resolve and/or fulfill the associated Promise, and  
¬†the error stops propagating.

Sometimes, in complex network environments, errors can occur more or less at random, and it can be appropriate to handle those errors by simply retrying the asynchronous request.

    queryDatabase()

    .catch(e => wait(500).then(queryDatabase))

    .then(displayTable)

    .catch(displayDatabaseError);

### Promises in¬†Parallel

Sometimes,we want to execute a number of asynchronous operations in parallel. The function `Promise.all()` can do this. `Promise.all()` takes an array of Promise objects as its input and returns a Promise.

The returned Promise will be rejected if any of the input Promises are rejected. Otherwise, it will be fulfilled with an array of the fulfillment values of each of the input Promises.

    const urls = [ /* zero or more URLs here */ ];

    promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url).then(r => r.text()));

    Promise.all(promises)

    .then(bodies => { /* do something with the array of strings */ })

    .catch(e => console.error(e));

The Promise returned by `Promise.all()` rejects when any of the input Promises is rejected. This happens immediately upon the first rejection and can happen while other input Promises are still pending. In ES2020, `Promise.allSettled()` takes an array of input  
¬†Promises and returns a Promise, just like Promise.all() does. But `Promise.allSettled()` never rejects the returned Promise, and it does not fulfill that Promise until all of the input Promises have settled. The Promise resolves to an array of objects, with one object for each input Promise. Each of these returned objects has a status property set to ‚Äúfulfilled‚Äù or ‚Äúrejected.‚Äù If the status is ‚Äúfulfilled‚Äù, then the object will also have a value property that gives the fulfillment value. And if the status is ‚Äúrejected‚Äù, then the object will also have a reason property that gives the error or rejection value of the corresponding Promise.

    Promise.allSettled([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.reject(2),3]).then(results => {

    results[0] // => { status: "fulfilled", value: 1 }

    results[1] // => { status: "rejected", reason: 2 }

    results[2] // => { status: "fulfilled", value: 3 }

    });

Occasionally, you may want to run a number of Promises at once but may only care about the value of the first one to fulfill. In that case, you can use `Promise.race()` instead of `Promise.all()`. It returns a Promise that is fulfilled or rejected when the first of the Promises in the input array is fulfilled or rejected.

### Making Promises

### Promises in¬†Sequence

### async and¬†await

These new keywords dramatically simplify the use of Promises and allow us to write Promise-based, asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code that blocks while waiting for network responses or other asynchronous events.

Asynchronous code can‚Äôt return a value or throw an exception the way that regular synchronous code can. And this is why Promises are designed the way the are. The value of a fulfilled Promise is like the return value of a synchronous function. And the value of a rejected Promise is like a value thrown by a synchronous function.

`async` and `await` take efficient, Promise-based code and hide the Promises so that your asynchronous code can be as easy to read and as easy to reason about as inefficient, blocking, synchronous code.

Given a Promise object p, the expression await p waits until p settles. If p fulfills, then the value of await p is the fulfillment value of p. On the other hand, if p is rejected, then the await p expression throws the rejection value of p.

    let response = await fetch("/api/user/profile");

    let profile = await response.json();

It is critical to understand right away that the `await` keyword does not cause your program to block and literally do nothing until the specified Promise settles. The code remains asynchronous, and the `await` simply disguises this fact. This means that any code that uses await is itself asynchronous.

### async Functions

Because any code that uses await is asynchronous, there is one critical rule: you can only use the await keyword within functions that have been declared with the `async` keyword.

    async function getHighScore() {

    let response = await fetch("/api/user/profile");

    let profile = await response.json();

    return profile.highScore;

    }

Declaring a function `async` means that the return value of the function will be a Promise even if no Promise-related code appears in the body of the function.

The `getHighScore()` function is declared `async`, so it returns a Promise. And because it returns a Promise, we can use the `await` keyword with it:

    displayHighScore(await getHighScore());

### Awaiting Multiple¬†Promises

Suppose that we‚Äôve written our `getJSON()` function using async:

    async function getJSON(url) {

    let response = await fetch(url);

    let body = await response.json();

    return body;

    }

And now suppose that we want to fetch two JSON values with this function

    let value1 = await getJSON(url1);

    let value2 = await getJSON(url2);

The problem with this code is that it is unnecessarily sequential: the fetch of the second URL will not begin until the first fetch is complete. If the second URL does not depend on the value obtained from the firstURL, then we should probably try to fetch the two values at the same time.

    let [value1, value2] = await Promise.all([getJSON(url1), getJSON(url2)]);

### The for/await Loop

Suppose you have an array of URLs:

    const urls = [url1, url2, url3];

You can call fetch() on each URL to get an array of Promises:

    const promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url));

We could now use` Promise.all()` to wait for all the Promises in the array to be fulfilled. But suppose we want the results of the first fetch as soon as they become available and don‚Äôt want to wait for all the URLs to be fetched.

    for(const promise of promises) {

    response = await promise;

    handle(response);

    }

‚Üê&gt;

    for await (const response of promises) {

    handle(response);

    }

both examples will only work if they are within functions declared async; a `for/await` loop is no different than a regular await expression in that way

## [Modules in Javascript](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/08/modules-in-javascript/)

#### **Differences between Node.js and¬†browsers**

There are many differences between Node.js and browser environments, but many of them are small and inconsequential in practice. For example, in our _Asynchronous_ lesson, we noted how [Node‚Äôs setTimeout](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_args) has a slightly different return value from [a browser‚Äôs setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout). Let‚Äôs go over a few notable differences between the two environments.

**Global vs Window**

In the Node.js runtime, the [global object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object) is the object where global variables are stored. In browsers, the [window object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) is where global variables are stored. The window also includes properties and methods that deal with drawing things on the screen like images, links, and buttons. Node doesn‚Äôt need to draw anything, and so it does not come with such properties. This means that you can‚Äôt reference window in Node.

_Most browsers allow you to reference global but it is really the same object as window._

**Document**

Browsers have access to a document object that contains the HTML of a page that will be rendered to the browser window. There is no document in Node.

**Location**

Browsers have access to a location that contains information about the web address being visited in the browser. There is no location in Node, since it is not on the web.

**Require and module.exports**

Node has a predefined require function that we can use to import installed modules like readline. We can also import and export across our own files using require and module.exports. For example, say we had two different files, animals.js and cat.js, that existed in the same directory:

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/cae36a07000d5dec8769d0e8cbc431b3>

If we execute animals.js in Node, the program would print ‚ÄòSennacy is a great pet!‚Äô.

Browsers don‚Äôt have a notion of a file system so we cannot use require or module.exports in the same way.

### The fs¬†module

Node comes with an [fs module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) that contains methods that allow us to interact with our computer‚Äôs **F**ile **S**ystem through JavaScript. No additional installations are required; to access this module we can simply `require` it. We recommend that you code along with this reading. Let‚Äôs begin with a `change-some-files.js` script that imports the module:

    // change-some-files.js

    const fs = require("fs");

Similar to what we saw in the `readline` lesson, `require` will return to us a object with many properties that will enable us to do file I/O.

**_Did you know?_** _I/O is short for input/output. It‚Äôs usage is widespread and all the hip tech companies are using it, like.io._

The `fs` module contains tons of functionality! Chances are that if there is some operation you need to perform regarding files, the `fs` module supports it. The module also offers both synchronous and asynchronous implementations of these methods. We prefer to not block the thread and so we‚Äôll opt for the asynchronous flavors of these methods.

### Creating a new¬†file

To create a file, we can use the `writeFile` method. According to the documentation, there are a few ways to use it. The most straight forward way is:

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/8898ad673bd2ecee9d93f8ec267cf213>

The code a[create-a-nnew-file.js (github.com)](https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/8898ad673bd2ecee9d93f8ec267cf213)bove will create a new file called `foo.txt` in the same directory as our `change-some-file.js` script. It will write the string `'Hello world!'` into that newly created file. The third argument specifies the encoding of the characters. There are different ways to encode characters; [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) is the most common and you‚Äôll use this in most scenarios. The fourth argument to `writeFile` is a callback that will be invoked when the write operation is complete. The docs indicate that if there is an error during the operation (such as an invalid encoding argument), an error object will be passed into the callback. This type of error handling is quite common for asynchronous functions. Like we are used to, since `writeFile` is asynchronous, we need to utilize _callback chaining_ if we want to guarantee that commands occur _after_ the write is complete or fails.

_Beware! If the file name specified to_ `writeFile` _already exists, it will completely overwrite the contents of that file._

We won‚Äôt be using the `foo.txt` file in the rest of this reading.

### Reading existing¬†files

To explore how to read a file, we‚Äôll use VSCode to manually create a `poetry.txt` file within the same directory as our `change-some-file.js` script. Be sure to create this if you are following along.

Our `poetry.txt` file will contain the following lines:

    My code fails

    I do not know why

    My code works

    I do not know why

We can use the `readFile` method to read the contents of this file. The method accepts very similar arguments to `writeFile`, except that the callback may be passed an error object and string containing the file contents. In the snippet below, we have replaced our previous `writeFile` code with `readFile`:

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/3623344a6292e5210c9a11307a5549e6>

> Running the code above would print the following in the terminal:

    THE CONTENTS ARE:

    My code fails

    I do not know why

    My code works

    I do not know why

Success! From here, you can do anything you please with the data read from the file. For example, since `data` is a string, we could split the string on the newline character `\n` to obtain an array of the file‚Äôs lines:

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/42a46d97654db0e6c6eef77f80b59606>

    THE CONTENTS ARE:

    [ 'My code fails',

    'I do not know why',

    'My code works',

    'I do not know why' ]

    The third line is My code works

### File I/O

_Using the same_ `poetry.txt` _file from before:_

    My code fails

    I do not know why

    My code works

    I do not know why

Let‚Äôs replace occurrences of the phrase ‚Äòdo not‚Äô with the word ‚Äòshould‚Äô.

We can read the contents of the file as a string, manipulate this string, then write this new string back into the file.

We‚Äôll need to utilize callback chaining in order for this to work since our file I/O is asynchronous:

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/8d3ba6828f5ba9a4692d0a938697099f>

Executing the script above will edit the `poetry.txt` file to contain:

    My code fails

    I should know why

    My code works

    I should know why

### Basic Syntax¬†Guide

This topic is meant to give you a very basic overview of how Markdown works, showing only some of the most common operations you use most frequently. Keep in mind that you can also use the Edit menus to inject markdown using the toolbar, which serves as a great way to see how Markdown works. However, Markdown‚Äôs greatest strength lies in its simplicity and keyboard friendly approach that lets you focus on writing your text and staying on the keyboard.

### What is¬†Markdown

Markdown is very easy to learn and get comfortable with due it‚Äôs relatively small set of markup ‚Äòcommands‚Äô. It uses already familiar syntax to represent common formatting operations. Markdown understands basic line breaks so you can generally just type text.

Markdown also allows for raw HTML inside of a markdown document, so if you want to embed something more fancy than what Markdowns syntax can do you can always fall back to HTML. However to keep documents readable that‚Äôs generally not recommended.

### Basic Markdown¬†Syntax

The following are a few examples of the most common things you are likely to do with Markdown while building typical documentation.

### Bold and¬†Italic

    markdown

    This text **is bold**.
    This text *is italic*.

This text is bold.  
This text _is italic_.

### Header Text

    markdown

    # Header 1
    ## Header 2
    ### Header 3
    #### Header 4
    ##### Header 5
    ###### Header 6

### Header 1

### Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

Header 5Header 6

### Line Continuation

By default Markdown adds paragraphs at double line breaks. Single line breaks by themselves are simply wrapped together into a single line. If you want to have soft returns that break a single line, add two spaces at the end of the line.

    markdown

    This line has a paragraph break at the end (empty line after).

    Theses two lines should display as a single
    line because there's no double space at the end.

    The following line has a soft break at the end (two spaces at end)
    This line should be following on the very next line.

This line has a paragraph break at the end (empty line after).

Theses two lines should display as a single line because there‚Äôs no double space at the end.

The following line has a soft break at the end (two spaces at end)  
This line should be following on the very next line.

### Links

If you need additional image tags like targets or title attributes you can also embed HTML directly:

    markdown

    Go the Help Builder sitest Wind site: <a href="http://west-wind.com/" target="_blank">Help Builder Site</a>.

### Images

### Block Quotes

Block quotes are callouts that are great for adding notes or warnings into documentation.

    markdown

    > ###  Headers break on their own
    > Note that headers don't need line continuation characters
    as they are block elements and automatically break. Only text
    lines require the double spaces for single line breaks.

> _Headers break on their own_

> _Note that headers don‚Äôt need line continuation characters as they are block elements and automatically break. Only text lines require the double spaces for single line breaks._

### Fontawesome Icons

Help Builder includes a custom syntax for [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) icons in its templates. You can embed a `@ icon-` followed by a font-awesome icon name to automatically embed that icon without full HTML syntax.

    markdown

    Gear:  Configuration

Configuration

### HTML Markup

You can also embed plain HTML markup into the page if you like. For example, if you want full control over fontawesome icons you can use this:

    markdown

    This text can be **embedded** into Markdown:
    <i class="fa fa-refresh fa-spin fa-lg"></i> Refresh Page

This text can be embedded into Markdown:  
¬†Refresh Page

### Unordered Lists

    markdown

    * Item 1
    * Item 2
    * Item 3
    This text is part of the third item. Use two spaces at end of the the list item to break the line.

    A double line break, breaks out of the list.

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3  
  This text is part of the third item. Use two spaces at end of the the list item to break the line.

A double line break, breaks out of the list.

### Ordered Lists

    markdown

    1. **Item 1**
    Item 1 is really something
    2. **Item 2**
    Item two is really something else

    If you want lines to break using soft returns use two spaces at the end of a line.

1.  Item 1 Item 1 is really something
2.  Item 2  
    Item two is really something else

If you want to lines to break using soft returns use to spaces at the end of a line.

### Inline Code

If you want to embed code in the middle of a paragraph of text to highlight a coding syntax or class/member name you can use inline code syntax:

    markdown

    Structured statements like `for x =1 to 10` loop structures
    can be codified using single back ticks.

Structured statements like `for x =1 to 10` loop structures can be codified using single back ticks.

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

Markdown supports code blocks syntax in a variety of ways:

    markdown

    The following code demonstrates:

        // This is code by way of four leading spaces
        // or a leading tab

    More text here

The following code demonstrates:

    pgsql

    // This is code by way of four leading spaces
    // or a leading tab

More text here

### Code Blocks

You can also use triple back ticks plus an optional coding language to support for syntax highlighting (space injected before last \` to avoid markdown parsing):

    markdown

    `` `csharp
    // this code will be syntax highlighted
    for(var i=0; i++; i < 10)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
    `` `

    csharp

    // this code will be syntax highlighted
    for(var i=0; i++; i < 10)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }

Many languages are supported: html, xml, javascript, css, csharp, foxpro, vbnet, sql, python, ruby, php and many more. Use the Code drop down list to get a list of available languages.

You can also leave out the language to get no syntax coloring but the code box:

    markdown

    `` `dos
    robocopy c:\temp\test d:\temp\test
    `` `

    dos

    robocopy c:\temp\test d:\temp\test

To create a formatted block but without formatting use the `txt` format:

    markdown

    `` `txt
    This is some text that will not be syntax highlighted
    but shows up in a code box.
    `` `

which gives you:

    text

    This is some text that will not be syntax highlighted
    but shows up in a code box.

### description:

_Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the_ `exec()` _and_ `test()` _methods of_ `RegExp`_, and with the_ `match()`_,_ `matchAll()`_,_ `replace()`_,_ `replaceAll()`_,_ `search()`_, and_ `split()` _methods of_ `String`_. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions._

### Creating a regular expression

You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

1.  **Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:**

`let re = /ab+c/;`

- Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

**2. Or calling the constructor function of the** `RegExp` **object, as follows:**

- `let re = new RegExp('ab+c');`

> _Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression_. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don‚Äôt know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.

### Writing a regular expression pattern

A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as `/abc/`, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as `/ab*c/` or `/Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/`.

The last example includes **parentheses, which are used as a memory device**. _The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use._

### Using simple¬†patterns

Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match.

For example, the pattern `/abc/` matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence `"abc"` occurs (all characters together and in that order).

Such a match would succeed in the strings `"Hi, do you know your abc's?"` and `"The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft."`

In both cases the match is with the substring `"abc"`.

There is no match in the string `"Grab crab"` because while it contains the substring `"ab c"`, it does not contain the exact substring `"abc"`.

### Using special characters

When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b‚Äôs, or finding white space, you can include special characters in the pattern.

For example, to match _a single_ `"a"` _followed by zero or more_ `"b"`_s followed by_ `"c"`, you‚Äôd use the pattern `/ab*c/`:

> the `*` after `"b"` means ‚Äú0 or more occurrences of the preceding item.‚Äù In the string `"cbbabbbbcdebc"`, this pattern will match the substring `"abbbbc"`.

[**Assertions**](https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Assertions.html)**¬†: Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions).**

[**Character classes**](https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes.html)**¬†: Distinguish different types of characters. For example, distinguishing between letters and digits.**

[**Groups and ranges**](https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Groups_and_Ranges.html)**¬†: Indicate groups and ranges of expression characters.**

[**Quantifiers**](https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Quantifiers.html)**¬†: Indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.**

[**Unicode property escapes**](https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Unicode_Property_Escapes.html)**¬†: Distinguish based on unicode character properties, for example, upper- and lower-case letters, math symbols, and punctuation.**

If you want to look at all the special characters that can be used in regular expressions in a single table, see the following:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Wk5zFr1IHJxacq2a2zi5RQ.png)

### Special characters in regular expressions.

### Escaping

If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually searching for a `"*"`, for instance), you must escape it by putting a **backslash** in front of it.

For instance, to search for `"a"` followed by `"*"` followed by `"b"`,

> you‚Äôd use `/a\*b/` ‚Äî the backslash ‚Äúescapes‚Äù the `"*"`, making it literal instead of special.

Similarly, if you‚Äôre writing a regular expression literal and need to match a slash (‚Äú/‚Äù), you need to escape that (otherwise, it terminates the pattern)

For instance, to search for the string ‚Äú/example/‚Äù followed by one or more alphabetic characters, you‚Äôd use `/\/example\/[a-z]+/i`

**‚Äìthe backslashes before each slash make them literal.**

To match a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash.

For instance, to match the string ‚ÄúC:\\‚Äù where ‚ÄúC‚Äù can be any letter,

you‚Äôd use `/[A-Z]:\\/`

‚Äî the first backslash escapes the one after it, so the expression searches for a single literal backslash.

If using the `RegExp` constructor with a string literal, **remember that the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal level**.

`/a\*b/` and `new RegExp("a\\*b")` create the same expression,

which searches for ‚Äúa‚Äù followed by a literal ‚Äú\*‚Äù followed by ‚Äúb‚Äù.

If escape strings are not already part of your pattern you can add them using `String.replace`:

    function escapeRegExp(string) {
      return string.replace(/[.*+\-?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole matched string
    }

**The ‚Äúg‚Äù after the regular expression is an option or flag that performs a global search, looking in the whole string and returning all matches.**

### Using parentheses

Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes that part of the matched substring to be remembered.

Once remembered, the substring can be recalled for other use.

### Using regular expressions in JavaScript

Regular expressions are used with the `RegExp` **methods**

`test()` **and** `exec()`

and with the `String` **methods** `match()`**,** `replace()`**,** `search()`**, and** `split()`**.**

---

### Method Descriptions

#### `exec()`

Executes a search for a match in a string.

It returns an array of information or `null` on a mismatch.

#### `test()`

Tests for a match in a string.

It returns `true` or `false`.

#### `match()`

Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or `null` if no match is found.

#### `matchAll()`

Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups.

#### `search()`

Tests for a match in a string.

It returns the index of the match, or `-1` if the search fails.

#### `replace()`

Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.

#### `replaceAll()`

Executes a search for all matches in a string, and replaces the matched substrings with a replacement substring.

#### `split()`

Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings.

### Methods that use regular expressions

When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the `test()` or `search()` methods;

for more information (but slower execution) use the `exec()` or `match()` methods.

If you use `exec()` or `match()` and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, `RegExp`.

If the **match fails, the** `exec()` **method returns** `null` (which coerces to `false`).

In the following example, the script uses the `exec()` method to find a match in a string.

    let myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
    let myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');

If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression, an alternative way of creating `myArray` is with this script:

    let myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
        // similar to "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g); however,
        // "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g) outputs Array [ "dbbd" ], while
        // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].

(See [different behaviors](https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions.md#g-different-behaviors) for further info about the different behaviors.)

If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet another alternative is this script:

    let myRe = new RegExp('d(b+)d', 'g');
    let myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');

With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and updates the properties shown in the following table.

Results of regular expression execution.

You can use a regular expression created with an object initializer without assigning it to a letiable.

If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular expression.

For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it to a letiable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that regular expression.

For example, assume you have this script:

    let myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
    let myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
    console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe.lastIndex);

    // "The value of lastIndex is 5"

However, if you have this script:

    let myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
    console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + /d(b+)d/g.lastIndex);

    // "The value of lastIndex is 0"

The occurrences of `/d(b+)d/g` in the two statements are different regular expression objects and hence have different values for their `lastIndex` property.

If you need to access the properties of a regular expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign it to a variable.

### \[Advanced searching with¬†flags\]

Regular expressions have **six optional flags** that allow for functionality like global and case insensitive searching.

These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression.

Flag Description Corresponding property

---

`g` Global search. `RegExp.prototype.global`

`i` Case-insensitive search. `RegExp.prototype.ignoreCase`

`m` Multi-line search. `RegExp.prototype.multiline`

`s` Allows¬†`.` to match newline characters. `RegExp.prototype.dotAll`

`u` ‚Äúunicode‚Äù; treat a pattern as a sequence of unicode code points. `RegExp.prototype.unicode`

`y` Perform a ‚Äústicky‚Äù search that matches starting at the current position in the target string. `RegExp.prototype.sticky`

#### Regular expression flags

_To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:_

    let re = /pattern/flags;

or

    let re = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');

Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They cannot be added or removed later.

For example, `re = /\w+\s/g` creates a regular expression that looks for one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this combination throughout the string.

    let re = /\w+\s/g;
    let str = 'fee fi fo fum';
    let myArray = str.match(re);
    console.log(myArray);

    // ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]

You could replace the line:

    let re = /\w+\s/g;

with:

    let re = new RegExp('\\w+\\s', 'g');

and get the same result.

The behavior associated with the `g` flag is different when the¬†`.exec()` method is used.

The roles of ‚Äúclass‚Äù and ‚Äúargument‚Äù get reversed:

In the case of¬†`.match()`, the string class (or data type) owns the method and the regular expression is just an argument,

while in the case of¬†`.exec()`, it is the regular expression that owns the method, with the string being the argument.

Contrast this `str.match(re)` versus `re.exec(str)`.

The `g` flag is used with the¬†`.exec()` method to get iterative progression.

    let xArray; while(xArray = re.exec(str)) console.log(xArray);
    // produces:
    // ["fee ", index: 0, input: "fee fi fo fum"]
    // ["fi ", index: 4, input: "fee fi fo fum"]
    // ["fo ", index: 7, input: "fee fi fo fum"]

The `m` flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be treated as multiple lines.

If the `m` flag is used, `^` and `$` match at the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start or end of the entire string.

### Using special characters to verify¬†input

In the following example, the user is expected to enter a phone number. When the user presses the ‚ÄúCheck‚Äù button, the script checks the validity of the number. If the number is valid (matches the character sequence specified by the regular expression), the script shows a message thanking the user and confirming the number. If the number is invalid, the script informs the user that the phone number is not valid.

Within non-capturing parentheses `(?:`¬†, the regular expression looks for three numeric characters `\d{3}` OR `|` a left parenthesis `\(` followed by three digits` \d{3}`, followed by a close parenthesis `\)`, (end non-capturing parenthesis `)`), followed by one dash, forward slash, or decimal point and when found, remember the character `([-\/\.])`, followed by three digits `\d{3}`, followed by the remembered match of a dash, forward slash, or decimal point `\1`, followed by four digits `\d{4}`.

The `Change` event activated when the user presses Enter sets the value of `RegExp.input`.

#### HTML

    <p>
      Enter your phone number (with area code) and then click "Check".
      <br>
      The expected format is like ###-###-####.
    </p>
    <form action="#">
      <input id="phone">
        <button onclick="testInfo(document.getElementById('phone'));">Check</button>
    </form>

#### JavaScript

    let re = /(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))([-\/\.])\d{3}\1\d{4}/;
    function testInfo(phoneInput) {
      let OK = re.exec(phoneInput.value);
      if (!OK) {
        console.error(phoneInput.value + ' isn\'t a phone number with area code!');
      } else {
        console.log('Thanks, your phone number is ' + OK[0]);}
    }

## [Writing Files Using¬†Python](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/06/writing-files-using-python/)

Basics of Writing Files in Python

close() to close th

As pointed out in a previous article that deals with reading data from files, file handling belongs to the essential knowledge of every professional Python programmer. This feature is a core part of the Python language, and no extra module needs to be loaded to do it properly.

### Basics of Writing Files in¬†Python

The common methods to operate with files are `open()` to open a file, `seek()` to set the file‚Äôs current position at the given offset, and `close()` to close the file afterwards. The `open()` method returns a file handle that represents a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) to be used to access the file for reading, writing, or appending.

Writing to a file requires a few decisions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe name of the file in which to store data and the access mode of the file. Available are two modes, writing to a new file (and overwriting any existing data) and appending data at the end of a file that already exists. The according abbreviations are ‚Äúw‚Äù, and ‚Äúa‚Äù, and have to be specified before opening a file.

In this article we will explain how to write data to a file line by line, as a list of lines, and appending data at the end of a file.

### Writing a Single Line to a¬†File

This first example is pretty similar to writing to files with the popular programming languages C and C++, as you‚Äôll see in _Listing 1_. The process is pretty straightforward. First, we open the file using the `open()` method for writing, write a single line of text to the file using the `write()` method, and then close the file using the `close()` method. Keep in mind that due to the way we opened the ‚Äúhelloworld.txt‚Äù file it will either be created if it does not exist yet, or it will be completely overwritten.

    filehandle = open('helloworld.txt', 'w')
    filehandle.write('Hello, world!\n')
    filehandle.close()

_Listing 1_

This entire process can be shortened using the `with` statement. _Listing 2_ shows how to write that. As already said before keep in mind that by opening the ‚Äúhelloworld.txt‚Äù file this way will either create if it does not exist yet or completely overwritten, otherwise.

    with open('helloworld.txt', 'w') as filehandle:
        filehandle.write('Hello, world!\n')

_Listing 2_

### Writing a List of Lines to a¬†File

In reality a file does not consist only of a single line, but much more data. Therefore, the contents of the file are stored in a list that represents a file buffer. To write the entire file buffer we‚Äôll use the `writelines()` method. _Listing 3_ gives you an example of this.

    filehandle = open("helloworld.txt", "w")
    filebuffer = ["a first line of text", "a second line of text", "a third line"]
    filehandle.writelines(filebuffer)
    filehandle.close()

_Listing 3_

Running the Python program shown in _Listing 3_ and then using the `cat` command we can see that the file ‚Äúhelloworld.txt‚Äù has the following content:

    $ cat helloworld.txt
    a first line of text a second line of text a third line

_Listing 4_

This happens because **the** `writelines()` **method does not automatically add any line separators when writing the data**. _Listing 5_ shows how to achieve that, writing each line of text on a single line by adding the line separator ‚Äú\\n‚Äù. Using a generator expression each line is substituted by the line plus line separator. Again, you can formulate this using the `with` statement.

    with open('helloworld.txt', 'w') as filehandle:
        filebuffer = ["a line of text", "another line of text", "a third line"]
        filehandle.writelines("%s\n" % line for line in filebuffer)

_Listing 5_

Now, the output file ‚Äúhelloworld.txt‚Äù has the desired content as shown in _Listing 6_:

    $ cat helloworld.txt
    a first line of text
    a second line of text
    a third line

_Listing 6_

Interestingly, there is a way to use output redirection in Python to write data to files. _Listing 7_ shows how to code that for Python 2.x.

    filename = "helloworld.txt"

    filecontent = ["Hello, world", "a second line", "and a third line"]

    with open(filename, 'w') as filehandle:

        for line in filecontent:
            print >>filehandle, line

_Listing 7_

For the latest Python releases this does not work in the same way anymore. To do something like this we must use the `sys` module. It allows us to access the UNIX standard output channels via `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdin`, and `sys.stderr`.

In our case we preserve the original value of the output channel `sys.stdout`, first (line 8 in the code below), redefine it to the handle of our output file,

next (line 15), print the data as usual (line 18), and finally restore the original value of the output channel `sys.stdout` (line 21). _Listing 8_ contains the example code.

    import sys

    filename = "helloworld.txt"

    original = sys.stdout

    filecontent = ["Hello, world", "a second line", "and a third line"]

    with open(filename, 'w') as filehandle:

        sys.stdout = filehandle

        for line in filecontent:
            print(line)


        sys.stdout = original

_Listing 8_

This is not necessarily best practice, but it does give you other options for writing lines to a file.

### Appending Data to a¬†File

So far, we have stored data in new files or in overwritten data in existing files. But what if we want to append data to the end of an existing file? In this case we would need to open the existing file using a different access mode. We change that to ‚Äòa‚Äô instead of ‚Äòw‚Äô.

_Listing 9_ shows how to handle that. And _Listing 10_ does the same thing, but it uses the `with` statement rather.

    filehandle = open('helloworld.txt','a')
    filehandle.write('\n' + 'Hello, world!\n')
    filehandle.close()

_Listing 9_

    with open('helloworld.txt', 'a') as filehandle:
        filehandle.write('\n' + 'Hello, world!\n')

_Listing 10_

Using the same helloworld.txt file from before, running this code will produce the following file contents:

    $ cat helloworld.txt
    Hello, world
    a second line
    and a third line

    Hello, world!

### Conclusion

Writing plain text data to files, or appending data to existing files, is as easy as reading from files in Python. As soon as a file is closed after writing or appending data, Python triggers a synchronization call. As a result, the updated file is immediately written to disk.

## [Learn CSS So That Your Site Doesn‚Äôt Look Like¬†Garbage](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/06/learn-css-so-that-your-site-doesnt-look-like-garbage/)

### CSS Selectors

- `CSS Selector`¬†: Applies styles to a specific DOM element(s), there are various types:
- `Type Selectors`¬†: Matches by node name.
- `Class Selectors`¬†: Matches by class name.
- `ID Selectors`¬†: Matches by ID name.
- `Universal Selectors`¬†: Selects all HTML elements on a page.
- `Attribute Selectors`¬†: Matches elements based on the prescence or value of a given attribute. (i.e. a\[title\] will match all a elements with a title attribute)

<!-- -->

    /* Type selector */
    div {
      background-color: #000000;
    }/* Class selector */
    .active {
      color: #ffffff;
    }/* ID selector */
    #list-1 {
      border: 1px solid gray;
    }/* Universal selector */
    * {
      padding: 10px;
    }/* Attribute selector */
    a[title] {
      font-size: 2em;
    }

**Class Selectors**

- Used to select all elements of a certain class denoted with a¬†`.[class name]`
- You can assign multiple classes to a DOM element by separating them with a space.

**Compound Class Selectors**

- To get around accidentally selecting elements with multiple classes beyond what we want to grab we can chain dots.
- TO use a compound class selector just append the classes together when referencing them in the CSS.

<!-- -->

    <div class="box yellow"></div>
    <div class="box orange"></div>
    <div class="circle orange"></div>

- i.e.¬†.box.yellow will select only the first element.
- KEEP IN MIND that if you do include a space it will make the selector into a _descendant selector_.

<!-- -->

    h1#heading,
    h2.subheading {
      font-style: italic;
    }

- When we want to target all `h1` tags with the id of `heading`.

**CSS Combinators**

- CSS Combinators are used to combine other selectors into more complex or targeted selectors‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are very powerful!
- Be careful not to use too many of them as they will make your CSS far too complex.
- `Descendant Selectors`
- Separated by a space.
- Selects all descendants of a parent container.
- `Direct Child Selectors`
- Indicated with a `>`.
- Different from descendants because it only affects the direct children of an element.
- `.menu > .is-active { background-color: #ffe0b2; }`
- `<body> <div class="menu"> <div class="is-active">Belka</div> <div> <div class="is-active">Strelka</div> </div> </div> </body> <div class="is-active"> Laika </div> </body>`
- Belka would be the only element selected.
- `Adjacent Sibling Selectors`
- Uses the `+` symbol.
- Used for elements that directly follow one another and who both have the same parent.
- `h1 + h2 { font-style: italic; } <h1>Big header</h1> <h2>This one is styled because it is directly adjacent to the H1</h2> <h2>This one is NOT styled because there is no H1 right before it</h2>`

**Pseudo-Classes**

- `Pseudo-Class`¬†: Specifies a special state of the seleted element(s) and does not refer to any elements or attributes contained in the DOM.
- Format is a `Selector:Pseudo-Class Name` or `A:B`
- `a:hover { font-family: "Roboto Condensed", sans-serif; color: #4fc3f7; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid #4fc3f7; }`
- Some common pseudo-classes that are frequently used are:
- `active`¬†: ‚Äòpush down‚Äô, when ele are activated.
- `checked`¬†: applies to things like radio buttons or checkbox inputs.
- `disabled`¬†: any disabled element.
- `first-child`¬†: first element in a group of children/siblings.
- `focus`¬†: elements that have current focus.
- `hover`¬†: elements that have cursor hovering over it.
- `invalid`¬†: any form elements in an invalid state from client-side form validation.
- `last-child`¬†: last element in a group of children/siblings.
- `not(selector)`¬†: elements that do not match the provided selector.
- `required`¬†: form elements that are required.
- `valid`¬†: form elements in a valid state.
- `visited`¬†: anchor tags of whih the user has already been to the URL that the href points to.

`Pseudo-Selectors`

- Used to create pseudo-elements as children of the elements to which the property applies.
- `::after`
- `::before`

<!-- -->

    <style>
      p::before {
        background-color: lightblue;
        border-right: 4px solid violet;
        content: ":-) ";
        margin-right: 4px;
        padding-left: 4px;
      }
    </style>
    <p>This is the first paragraph</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph</p>
    <p>This is the third paragraph</p>

- Will add some blue smiley faces before the p tag elements.

**CSS Rules**

- `CSS Rule`¬†: Collection of single or compound selectors, a curly brace, zero or more properties
- `CSS Rule Specificity`¬†: Sometimes CSS rules will contain multiple elements and may have overlapping properties rules for those same elements ‚Äì there is an algorithm in CSS that calculates which rule takes precedence.
- `The Four Number Calculation`¬†: listed in increasing order of importance.

Who has the most IDs? If no one, continue.

Who has the most classes? If no one, continue.

Who has the most tags? If no one, continue.

Last Read in the browser wins.

    <style>
      .box {

        height: 50px;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      .orange {
        background-color: orange;
      }
      .yellow {
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid purple;
      }
    </style>
    <div class="box yellow"></div>
    <div class="box orange"></div>

- Coming back to our example where all the CSS Rules have tied, the last step 4 wins out so our element will have a `purple border`.

---

### CSS: Type, Properties, and¬†Imports

**Typography**

- `font-family`¬†: change the font.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ssVcT1Bd9Edfo6KF)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WmqUyKiumM8RCJQo.png)

- Remember that not all computers have the same fonts on them.
- You can import web fonts via an api by using
- `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&display=swap');` and pasting it st the top of your CSS file.
- And then reference it in your font-family.
- `font-size`¬†: Changes the size of your font.
- Keep in mind the two kind of units CSS uses:
- `Absolute`¬†: `Pixels`, Points, Inches, Centimeters.
- `Relative`¬†: Em, Rem.
- Em: Calulating the size relative to the previous div (bubbles down)
- Rem: Calulates relative to the parent element always.
- `font-style`¬†: Used to set a font to italics.
- `font-weight`¬†: Used to make a font bold.
- `text-align`¬†: Used to align your text to the left, center, or right.
- `text-decoration`¬†: Use to put lines above, through, or under text. Lines can be solid, dashed, or wavy!
- `text-transform`¬†: Used to set text to all lowercase, uppercase, or capitalize all words.

**Background-Images**

- You can use the background-image property to set a background image for an element.

---

### CSS: Colors, Borders, and¬†Shadows

**Colors**

- You can set colors in CSS in three popular ways: by name, by hexadecimal RGB value, and by their decimal RGB value.
- rgba() is used to make an rbg value more transparent, the `a` is used to specify the `alpha channel`.
- **Color**¬†: Property used to change the color of text.
- **Background-Color**¬†: Property to change the backgrounf color of an element.

**Borders**

- Borders take three values: The width of the border, the style (i.e. solid, dotted, dashed), color of the border.

**Shadows**

- There are two kinds of shadows in CSS: `box shadows` and `text shadows`.
- Box refers to HTML elements.
- Text refers to text.
- Shadows take values such as, the horizontal & vertical offsets of the shadow, the blur radius of the shadow, the spread radius, and of course the colors.

---

### The Box¬†Model

**Box Model**¬†: A concept that basically boils down that every DOM element has a box around it.

Imagine a gift, inside is the gift, wrapped in foam all around (padding), and the giftbox outside of it (border) and then a wrapping paper on the giftbox (margin).- For items that are using `block` as it‚Äôs display, the browser will follow these rules to layout the element: ‚Äì The box fills 100% of the available container space. ‚Äì Every new box takes on a new line/row. ‚Äì Width and Height properties are respected. ‚Äì Padding, Margin, and Border will push other elements away from the box. ‚Äì Certain elements have `block` as their default display, such as: divs, headers, and paragraphs.- For items that are using `inline` as it‚Äôs display, the browser will follow these rules to layout the element: ‚Äì Each box appears in a single line until it fills up the space. ‚Äì Width and height are **not** respected. ‚Äì Padding, Margin, and Border are applied but they **do not** push other elements away from the box. ‚Äì Certain elements have `inline` as their default display, such as: span tags, anchors, and images.

**Standard Box Model vs Border-Box**‚Äì As per the standard Box Model, the width and height pertains to the content of the box and excludes any additional padding, borders, and margins.

This bothered many programmers so they created the **border box** to include the calculation of the entire box‚Äôs height and width.

**Inline-Block**‚Äì Inline-block uses the best features of both `block` and `inline`. ‚Äì Elements still get laid out left to right. ‚Äì Layout takes into account specified width and height.

**Padding**‚Äì Padding applies padding to every side of a box. It is shorthand for four padding properties in this order: `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left` (clockwise!)

**Border**‚Äì Border applies a border on all sides of an element. It takes three values in this order: `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color`. ‚Äì All three properties can be broken down in the four sides clockwise: top, right, bottom, left.

**Margin**‚Äì Margin sets margins on every side of an element. It takes four values in this order: `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`. ‚Äì You can use `margin: 0 auto` to center an element.

### Positioning

- The `position` property allows us to set the position of elements on a page and is an integral part of creatnig a Web page layout.
- It accepts five values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`.
- Every property (minus `static`) is used with: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position an element on a page.

**Static Positioning**

- The default position value of page elements.
- Most likely will not use static that much.

**Relative Positioning**

- Remains in it‚Äôs original position in the page flow.
- It is positioned _RELATIVE_ to the it‚Äôs _ORIGINAL PLACE_ on the page flow.
- Creates a **stacking context**¬†: overlapping elements whose order can be set by the z-index property.

<!-- -->

    #pink-box {
      background-color: #ff69b4;
      bottom: 0;
      left: -20px;
      position: relative;
      right: 0;
      top: 0;
    }

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TgjpfTmdczESRAfU.png)

**Absolute Positioning**

- Absolute elements are removed from the normal page flow and other elements around it act like it‚Äôs not there. (how we can easily achieve some layering)
- Here are some examples to illustration absolute positioning:

- Note that the container ele has a relative positioning‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is so that any changes made to the absolute positioned children will be positioned from it‚Äôs top-left corner.
- Note that because we removed the pink from the normal page flow, the container has now shifted the blue box to where the pink box should have been‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is why it is now layered beneath the pink.

<!-- -->

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*o_T8meZgQSu7kxfs.png)

- As you can see here, since we have also taken the blue box out of the normal page flow by declaring it as absoutely positioned it now overlaps over the pink box.

<!-- -->

    .container {
      background-color: #2b2d2f;
      position: relative;

      background-color: #ff69b4;

- Example where the absolute element has it‚Äôs bottom property modified.

    .container {
      background-color: #2b2d2f;

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Al6ILt84EC0bhjnK.png)

- If we removed the container‚Äôs relative position. Our absolute unit would look for the nearest parent which would be the document itself.

**Fixed Positioning**

- Another positioning that removes it‚Äôs element from the page flow, and automatically positions it‚Äôs parent as the HTML doc itself.
- Fixed also uses top, right, bottom, and left.
- Useful for things like nav bars or other features we want to keep visible as the user scrolls.

**Sticky Positioning**

- Remains in it‚Äôs original position in the page flow, and it is positioned relative to it‚Äôs closest block-level ancestor and any _scrolling_ ancestors.
- Behaves like a relatively positioned element until the point at which you would normally scroll past it‚Äôs viewport‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen it sticks!
- It is positioned with top, right, bottom, and left.
- A good example are headers in a scrollable list.

### Flexible Box¬†Model

- Flexbox is a **CSS module** that provides a convenient way for us to display items inside a flexible container so that the layout is responsive.
- Float was used back in the day to display position of elements in a container.
- A very inconvenient aspect of float is the need to _clear_ the float.
- To ‚Äòclear‚Äô a float we need to set up a ghost div to properly align‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is already sounds so inefficient.

**Using Flexbox**

- Flexbox automatically resizes a container element to fit the viewport size without needing to use breakpoints.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_SXOQpq3yrywWCcL)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IBJIWQ7Z_23eERWn.png)

- Flexbox layout applies styles to the parent element, and it‚Äôs children.

<!-- -->

    .container {
      display: flex; /*sets display to use flex*/
      flex-wrap: wrap; /*bc flex tries to fit everything into one line, use wrap to have the elements wrap to the next line*/
      flex-direction: row; /*lets us create either rows or columns*/
    }

- `flex-flow` can be used to combine wrap and direction.
- `justify-content` used to define the alignment of flex items along the main axis.
- `align-items` used to define the alignment on the Y-axis.
- `align-content` redistributes extra space on the cross axis.
- By default, flex items will appear in the order they are added to the DOM, but we can use the `order` property to change that.
- Some other properties we can use on flex items are:
- `flex-grow`¬†: dictates amount of avail. space the item should take up.
- `flex-shrink`¬†: defines the ability for a flex item to shrink.
- `flex-basis`¬†: Default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
- `flex`¬†: shorthand for grow, shrink and basis.
- `align-self`¬†: Overrides default alignment in the container.

---

### Grid Layout

- CSS Grid is a 2d layout system that let‚Äôs use create a grid with columns and rows purely using Vanilla CSS. (flex is one dimensional)

**Bootstrap vs CSS Grid**

- Bootstrap was a front-end library commonly used to create grid layouts but now CSS grid provides greater flexibility and control.
- Grid applies style to a parent container and it‚Äôs child elements.

<!-- -->

    .grid-container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: auto;
      grid-template-areas:
        "header header header"
        "main . sidebar"
        "footer footer footer";  grid-column-gap: 20px;
      grid-row-gap: 30px;
      justify-items: stretch;
      align-items: stretch;
      justify-content: stretch;
      align-content: stretch;
    }.item-1 {
      grid-area: header;
    }
    .item-2 {
      grid-area: main;
    }
    .item-3 {
      grid-area: sidebar;
    }
    .item-4 {
      grid-area: footer;
    }

- Columns and Rows can be defined with: pixels, percentages, auto, named grid lines, using `repeat`, fractions.
- `Grid Template Areas` gives us a handy way to map out and visualize areas of the grid layout.
- Combine areas with templates to define how much space an area should take up.
- `Grid Gaps` can be used to create ‚Äògutters‚Äô between grid item.s
- The way we have defined our grid with `grid-templates` and `areas` are considered **explicit**.
- We can also `implicitly` define grids.

<!-- -->

    .grid-container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px 100px;
      grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
      grid-auto-columns: 100px;
      grid-auto-rows: 50px;
    }

- Any grid items that aren‚Äôt explicity placed are automatically placed or _re-flowed_

**Spanning Columns & Rows**

- We can use the following properties to take up a specified num of cols and rows.
- `grid-column-start`
- `grid-column-end`
- `grid-row-start`
- `grid-row-end`
- All four properties can take any of the following values: the line number, span \#, span name, auto.

<!-- -->

    .item-1 {
      grid-row-start: row2-start; /* Item starts at row line named "row2-start" */
      grid-row-end: 5; /* Item ends at row line 5 */
      grid-column-start: 1; /* Item starts at column line 1 */
      grid-column-end: three; /* Item ends at column line named "three" */
    }.item-2 {
      grid-row-start: 1; /* Item starts at row line 1 */
      grid-row-end: span 2; /* Item spans two rows and ends at row line 3 */
      grid-column-start: 3; /* Item starts at column line 3 */
      grid-column-end: span col5-start; /* Item spans and ends at line named "col5-start" */
    }

**Grid Areas**

- We use the grid areas in conjunction with grid-container property to **define sections of the layout**.
- We can then assign named sections to individual element‚Äôs css rules.

**Justify & Align Self**

- Justify items and Align Items can be used to align all grid items at once.
- **Justify Self** is used to align self on the row.
- It can take four values: start, end, center, stretch.
- **Align Self** is used to align self on the column.
- It can take four values: start, end, center, stretch.

---

**CSS Hover Effect and Handling**

**Overflow**

`css .btn { background-color: #00bfff; color: #ffffff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1.5rem; }`

`.btn--active:hover { cursor: pointer; transform: translateY(-0.25rem);`

`/* Moves our button up/down on the Y axis */ }`

The Pseudo Class Selector `hover` activates when the cursor goes over the selected element.

**Content Overflow**‚Äì You can apply an `overflow` content property to an element if it‚Äôs inner contents are spilling over.

There are three members in the overflow family:‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`overflow-x`¬†: Apply horizontally. ‚Äì `overflow-y`¬†: Apply vertically. ‚Äì `overflow`¬†: Apply both directions.

### Transitions

- Transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.
- **Implicit Transitions**¬†: Animations that involve transitioning between two states.

**Defining Transitions**

- `transition-property`¬†: specifies the name of the CSS property to apply the transition.
- `transition-duration`¬†: during of the transition.
- `transition-delay`¬†: time before the transition should start.

**Examples**¬†:

    #delay {
      font-size: 14px;
      transition-property: font-size;
      transition-duration: 4s;
      transition-delay: 2s;
    }#delay:hover {
      font-size: 36px;
    }

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Z6AbWnbmbFfu-tSM)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_6nSuCOR34-6ET7n.gif)

- After a delay of two seconds, a four second transition begins where the font size goes from 36px to 14px.

<!-- -->

    .box {
      border-style: solid;
      border-width: 1px;
      display: block;
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: #0000ff;
      transition: width 2s, height 2s, background-color 2s, transform 2s;
    }.box:hover {
      background-color: #ffcccc;
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      transform: rotate(180deg);
    }

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PH5_YmVDFVGqWGjO)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ya7xiy0AqJaJ9RPq.gif)

- When the mouse hovers over a box, it spins due to the rotate transform. Width and height change and also the bg color.

### BEM Guidelines

- BEM was created as a guideline to solve the issue of loose standards around CSS naming conventions.
- **BEM** stands for `block`, `element`, `modifier`.
- **Block**
- A standalone entity that is meaningful on it‚Äôs own.
- Can be nested and interact with one another.
- Holistic entities without DOM rep can be blocks.
- May consist latin letters, digits, and dashes.
- Any DOM node can be a block if it accepts a class name.
- **Element**
- Part of a block and has no standalone meaning.
- Any element that is semantically tied to a block.
- May consist latin letters, digits, and dashes.
- Formed by using two underscores after it‚Äôs block name.
- Any DOM node within a block can be an element.
- Element classes should be used independently.
- **Modifier**
- A flag on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state.
- Extra class name to add onto blocks or elements.
- Add mods only to the elements they modify.
- Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores.
- Written with two dashes.

**BEM Example**

    <form class="form form--theme-xmas form--simple">
      <input class="form__input" type="text" />
      <input class="form__submit form__submit--disabled" type="submit" />
    </form>/* block selector */
    .form {
    }/* block modifier selector */
    .form--theme-xmas {
    }/* block modifier selector */
    .form--simple {
    }/* element selector */
    .form__input {
    }/* element selector */
    .form__submit {
    }/* element modifier selector */
    .form__submit--disabled {
    }

## [PostgreSQL Setup For Windows &¬†WSL/Ubuntu](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/05/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*mhTM08D1J612VW7J)

If you follow this guide to a tee‚Ä¶ you will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will install `psql` in your Ubuntu installation. Then you will also install Postbird, a cross-platform graphical user interface that makes working with SQL and PostgreSQL ‚Äòallegedly‚Äô¬†‚Ä¶(personally I prefer to just use the command line but PG Admin makes for an immeasurably more complicated tutorial than postbird)‚Ä¶ better than just using the **command line tool** `psql`**.**

### Important Distinction: PSQL is the frontend interface for PostgreSQL¬†‚Ä¶ they are not synonymous!

**Postgres**, is a [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system "Relational database management system") (RDBMS)

**PSQL:**

The primary [front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends "Front and back ends") for PostgreSQL is the `psql` [command-line program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_program "Command-line program"), which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file.

In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.

**pgAdmin:**

The pgAdmin package is a free and open-source [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface") (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL.

When you read ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù, that means the actual OS that‚Äôs running on your machine. So, you have a Windows installation, Windows 10, that‚Äôs running when you boot your computer. Then, when you start the Ubuntu installation, it‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs a completely separate computer running inside your computer. It‚Äôs like having two completely different laptops.

### Other Noteworthy Distinctions:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*um8fm6FDTYYOXZrLudddpg.png)

### Installing PostgreSQL 12

To install PostgreSQL 12, you need to download the installer from the Internet. PostgreSQL‚Äôs commercial company, Enterprise DB, offers installers for PostgreSQL for every major platform.

Open <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>. Click the link for PostgreSQL 12 for Windows x86-64.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wi4EbaVo-mamG_tH.png)

Once that installer downloads, run it. You need to go through the normal steps of installing software.

- Yes, Windows, let the installer make changes to _my_ device.
- Thanks for the welcome. Next.
- Yeah, that‚Äôs a good place to install it. Next.
- I don‚Äôt want that pgAdmin nor the Stack Builder things. Uncheck. Uncheck. Next.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PSDmTsaD37MgFJ-A.png)

- Also, great looking directory. Thanks. Next.

### Oooh! A password! I‚Äôll enter **\*\*\*\***. I sure won‚Äôt forget that because, if I do, I‚Äôll have to uninstall and reinstall PostgreSQL and lose all of my hard work. **Seriously, write down this password or use one you will not forget!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

### I REALLY CANNOT STRESS THE ABOVE POINT ENOUGH‚Ä¶ Experience is a great teacher but in this case¬†‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not worth¬†it.

- Sure. 5432. Good to go. Next.
- Not even sure what that means. Default! Next.
- Yep. Looks good. Next.

Insert pop culture reference to pass the time

### Installing PostgreSQL Client Tools on¬†Ubuntu

Now, to install the PostgreSQL Client tools for Ubuntu. You need to do this so that the Node.js (and later Python) programs running on your Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on your Windows installation. You need to tell `apt`, the package manager, that you want it to go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package repositories. You do that by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn‚Äôt running, start one.)

**Pro-tip**: Copy those commands because you‚Äôre not going to type them, right? After you copy one of them, you can just right-click on the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for you.

    wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

If prompted for your password, type it.

    echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

The last line of output of those two commands running should read ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. If it does not, try copying and pasting them one at a time.

Now that you‚Äôve registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look for PostgreSQL, you need to update the `apt` registry. You should do this before you install _any_ software on Ubuntu.

    sudo apt update

Once that‚Äôs finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be in the repository. Now, you can install them with the following command.

    sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common

If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it ‚ÄúY‚Äù.

Test that it installed by typing `psql --version`. You should see it print out information about the version of the installed tools. If it tells you that it can‚Äôt find the command, try these instructions over.

### Configuring the client¬†tools

Since you‚Äôre going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your Ubuntu installation on your Windows installation, you‚Äôre going to have to type that you want to access it over and over, which means extra typing. To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to always add the extra commands for you.

This assumes you‚Äôre still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your Ubuntu installation uses, please follow that shell‚Äôs directions for adding an alias to its startup file.

Make sure you‚Äôre in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing `cd` and hitting enter. Use `ls` to find out if you have a¬†`.bashrc` file. Type `ls .bashrc`. If it shows you that one exists, that‚Äôs the one you will add the alias to. If it tells you that there is no file named that, then type `ls .profile`. If it shows you that one exists, that‚Äôs the one you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then use the file name¬†`.bashrc` in the following section.

Now that you know which profile file to use, type `code ¬´profile file name¬ª` where ‚Äúprofile file name‚Äù is the name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you‚Äôve already added aliases, in that section), type the following.

    alias psql="psql -h localhost"

When you run `psql` from the command line, it will now always add the part about wanting to connect to _localhost_ every time. You would have to type that each time, otherwise.

To make sure that you set that up correctly, type `psql -U postgres postgres`. This tells the `psql` client that you want to connect as the user ‚Äúpostgres‚Äù (`-U postgres`) to the database postgres (`postgres` at the end), which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password that you used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly and you type the correct password, then you should see something like the following output.

    psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=#

Type `\q` and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.

Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don‚Äôt have to specify it all the time. Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL will use to automatically send your password every time.

Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password that you want to use for your user. **Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the password that you want.** It _has_ to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs not.

    psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER"

It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created when you installed PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you should see ‚ÄúCREATE ROLE‚Äù.

Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into your Ubuntu shell to open Visual Studio Code and create a new file.

    code ~/.pgpass

In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for port 5432 (where PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (\*), **use your Ubuntu user name and the password that you just created for that user with the** `psql` **command you just typed.** (If you have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type `whoami` on the command line.) Your entry in the file should have this format.

    localhost:5432:*:¬´your Ubuntu user name¬ª:¬´the password you just used¬ª

Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual Studio Code.

The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so that it is only readable by your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just anyone can read and write to it. This is for _your_ security. Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did this once upon a time. Here‚Äôs the command.

    chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass

You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing `ls -al ~/.pgpass`. That should return output that looks like this, **with your Ubuntu user name instead of ‚Äúweb-dev-hub‚Äù.**

    -rw------- 1 web-dev-hub web-dev-hub 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/web-dev-hub/.pgpass

Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing `psql postgres`. Because you added the alias to your startup script, and because you created your¬†**.pgpass** file, it should now connect without prompting you for any credentials! Type `\q` and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL command line client.

### Installing Postbird

Head over to the [Postbird releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/releases). Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it‚Äôs the only file in the list that ends with ‚Äú.exe‚Äù.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZdKurvQ4bHs3vDLT.png)

After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from Windows that this is from an unidentified developer. If you don‚Äôt want to install this, find a PostgreSQL GUI client that you do trust and install it or do everything from the command line.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EWpFEwM0YUDQCW_i.png)

You should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications aren‚Äôt signed with the Microsoft Store for monetary and philosophical reasons.

Otherwise, if you trust Paxa like web-dev-hub and tens of thousands of other developers do, then click the link that reads ‚ÄúMore info‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRun anyway‚Äù button.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9pDpx8XsYt2KnMku.png)

When it‚Äôs done installing, it will launch itself. Test it out by typing the ‚Äúpostgres‚Äù into the ‚ÄúUsername‚Äù field and the password from your installation in the ‚ÄúPassword‚Äù field. Click the Connect button. It should properly connect to the running

You can close it for now. It also installed an icon on your desktop. You can launch it from there or your Start Menu at any time.

### Now.. if you still have some gas in the tank‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs put our new tools to¬†work:

### The node-postgres

The node-postgres is a collection of Node.js modules for interfacing with the PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, and streaming results.

In our examples we also use the Ramda library. See Ramda tutorial for more information.

### Setting up node-postgres

First, we install node-postgres.

$ node -v  
v14.2

$ npm init -y

We initiate a new Node application.

npm i pg

We install node-postgres with `nmp i pg`.

npm i ramda

In addition, we install Ramda for beautiful work with data.

cars.sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cars;

CREATE TABLE cars(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), price INT);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòAudi‚Äô, 52642);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòMercedes‚Äô, 57127);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòSkoda‚Äô, 9000);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòVolvo‚Äô, 29000);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòBentley‚Äô, 350000);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòCitroen‚Äô, 21000);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòHummer‚Äô, 41400);  
INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‚ÄòVolkswagen‚Äô, 21600);

In some of the examples, we use this `cars` table.

### The node-postgres first¬†example

In the first example, we connect to the PostgreSQL database and return a simple SELECT query result.

first.js

    const pg = require(‚Äòpg‚Äô);
    const R = require(‚Äòramda‚Äô);
    const cs = ‚Äòpostgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb‚Äô;
    const client = new pg.Client(cs);
    client.connect();
    client.query(‚ÄòSELECT 1 + 4‚Äô).then(res => {

    const result = R.head(R.values(R.head(res.rows)))

    console.log(result)
    }).finally(() => client.end());

The example connects to the database and issues a SELECT statement.

    const pg = require(‚Äòpg‚Äô);
    const R = require(‚Äòramda‚Äô);

We include the `pg` and `ramda` modules.

    const cs = ‚Äòpostgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb‚Äô;

This is the PostgreSQL connection string. It is used to build a connection to the database.

    const client = new pg.Client(cs);
    client.connect();

A client is created. We connect to the database with `connect()`.

    client.query(‚ÄòSELECT 1 + 4‚Äô).then(res => {

    const result = R.head(R.values(R.head(res.rows)));

    console.log(result);

    }).finally(() => client.end());

We issue a simple SELECT query. We get the result and output it to the console. The `res.rows` is an array of objects; we use Ramda to get the returned scalar value. In the end, we close the connection with `end()`.

    node first.js
    5

This is the output.

### The node-postgres column¬†names

In the following example, we get the columns names of a database.

> column_names.js

    const pg = require(‚Äòpg‚Äô);

    const cs = ‚Äòpostgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb‚Äô;

    const client = new pg.Client(cs);

    client.connect();

    client.query(‚ÄòSELECT * FROM cars‚Äô).then(res => {

    const fields = res.fields.map(field => field.name);

    console.log(fields);

    }).catch(err => {
    console.log(err.stack);
    }).finally(() => {
    client.end()
    });

The column names are retrieved with `res.fields` attribute. We also use the `catch` clause to output potential errors.

    node column_names.js
    ‚Äòid‚Äô, ‚Äòname‚Äô, ‚Äòprice‚Äô‚Ä≤id‚Ä≤,‚Ä≤name‚Ä≤,‚Ä≤price‚Ä≤

The output shows three column names of the `cars` table.

### Selecting all¬†rows

In the next example, we select all rows from the database table.

> all_rows.js

    const pg = require(‚Äòpg‚Äô);
    const R = require(‚Äòramda‚Äô);

    const cs = ‚Äòpostgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb‚Äô;

    const client = new pg.Client(cs);

    client.connect();

    client.query(‚ÄòSELECT * FROM cars‚Äô).then(res => {

    const data = res.rows;

    console.log('all data');
    data.forEach(row => {
        console.log(\`Id: ${row.id} Name: ${row.name} Price: ${row.price}\`);
    })

    console.log('Sorted prices:');
    const prices = R.pluck('price', R.sortBy(R.prop('price'), data));
    console.log(prices);

    }).finally(() => {
    client.end()
    });

## [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/05/emmet-cheat-sheet/)

### EMMET

_The a toolkit for web-developers_

### Introduction

Emmet is a productivity toolkit for web developers that uses expressions to generate HTML snippets.

### Installation

Normally, installation for Emmet should be a straight-forward process from the package-manager, as most of the modern text editors support Emmet.

### Usage

You can use Emmet in two ways:

- Tab Expand Way: Type your emmet code and press `Tab` key
- Interactive Method: Press `alt + ctrl + Enter` and start typing your expressions. This should automatically generate HTML snippets on the fly.

**This cheatsheet will assume that you press** `Tab` **after each expressions.**

### HTML

### Generating HTML 5¬†DOCTYPE

`html:5`  
Will generate

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
      <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
    </html>

### Child items

Child items are created using `>`

`ul>li>p`

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

### Sibling Items

Sibling items are created using `+`

`html>head+body`

    <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>

    </body>
    </html>

### Multiplication

Items can be multiplied by `*`

`ul>li*5`

    <ul>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

### Grouping

Items can be grouped together using `()`

`table>(tr>th*5)+tr>t*5`

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
      </tr>
    </table>

### Class and¬†ID

Class and Id in Emmet can be done using¬†`.` and `#`

`div.heading`

    <div class="heading"></div>

`div#heading`

    <div id="heading"></div>

ID and Class can also be combined together

`div#heading.center`

    <div id="heading" class="center"></div>

### Adding Content inside¬†tags

Contents inside tags can be added using `{}`

`h1{Emmet is awesome}+h2{Every front end developers should use this}+p{This is paragraph}*2`

    <h1>Emmet is awesome</h1>
    <h2>Every front end developers should use this</h2>
    <p>This is paragraph</p>
    <p>This is paragraph</p>

### Attributes inside HTML¬†tags

Attributes can be added using `[]`

`a[href=https://?google.com data-toggle=something target=_blank]`

    <a href="https://?google.com" data-toggle="something" target="_blank"></a>

### Numbering

Numbering can be done using `$`  
You can use this inside tag or contents.

`h${This is so awesome $}*6`

    <h1>This is so awesome 1</h1>
    <h2>This is so awesome 2</h2>
    <h3>This is so awesome 3</h3>
    <h4>This is so awesome 4</h4>
    <h5>This is so awesome 5</h5>
    <h6>This is so awesome 6</h6>

Use `@-` to reverse the Numbering

`img[src=image$$@-.jpg]*5`

    <img src="image05.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image04.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image03.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image02.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image01.jpg" alt="">

To start the numbering from specific number, use this way

`img[src=emmet$@100.jpg]*5`

    <img src="emmet100.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet101.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet102.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet103.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet104.jpg" alt="">

### Tips

- Use¬†`:` to expand known abbreviations

`input:date`

    <input type="date" name="" id="">

`form:post`

    <form action="" method="post"></form>

`link:css`

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

- Building Navbar

`.navbar>ul>li*3>a[href=#]{Item $@-}`

    <div class="navbar">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

### CSS

Emmet works surprisingly well with css as well.

- `f:l`

<!-- -->

    float: left;

You can also use any options n/r/l

- `pos:a¬≠`

<!-- -->

    position: absolute;

Also use any options, pos:a/r/f

- `d:n/b¬≠/f/¬≠i/ib`

`d:ib`

    display: inline-block;

- You can use `m` for margin and `p` for padding followed by direction

`mr` -&gt; `margin-right`

`pr` -&gt; `padding-right`

- `@f` will result in

<!-- -->

    @font-face {
      font-family:;
      src:url();
    }

You can also use these shorthands

## [Python Study Guide for a JavaScript¬†Programmer](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/05/python-study-guide-for-a-javascript-programmer/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3V9VOfPk_hrFdbEAd3j-QQ.png)

### Applications of Tutorial & Cheat Sheet Respectivley (At Bottom Of Tutorial):

### Basics

- **PEP8**¬†: Python Enhancement Proposals, style-guide for Python.
- `print` is the equivalent of `console.log`.

> ‚Äòprint() == console.log()‚Äô

### `#` is used to make comments in your¬†code.

    def foo():
        """
        The foo function does many amazing things that you
        should not question. Just accept that it exists and
        use it with caution.
        """
        secretThing()

> _Python has a built in help function that let‚Äôs you see a description of the source code without having to navigate to it‚Ä¶ ‚Äú-SickNasty¬†‚Ä¶ Autor Unknown‚Äù_

---

### Numbers

- Python has three types of numbers:

1.  **Integer**
2.  **Positive and Negative Counting Numbers.**

No Decimal Point

> Created by a literal non-decimal point number¬†‚Ä¶ **or**¬†‚Ä¶ with the `int()` constructor.

    print(3) # => 3
    print(int(19)) # => 19
    print(int()) # => 0

**3. Complex Numbers**

> Consist of a real part and imaginary part.

#### Boolean is a subtype of integer in Python.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

> If you came from a background in JavaScript and learned to accept the premise(s) of the following meme‚Ä¶

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*eC4EvZcv6hhH88jX.png)

> Than I am sure you will find the means to suspend your disbelief.

    print(2.24) # => 2.24
    print(2.) # => 2.0
    print(float()) # => 0.0
    print(27e-5) # => 0.00027

### KEEP IN¬†MIND:

> **The** `i` **is switched to a** `j` **in programming.**

T\*his is because the letter i is common place as the de facto index for any and all enumerable entities so it just makes sense not to compete for name-\***_space_** _when there‚Äôs another 25 letters that don‚Äôt get used for every loop under the sun. My most medium apologies to Leonhard Euler._

    print(7j) # => 7j
    print(5.1+7.7j)) # => 5.1+7.7j
    print(complex(3, 5)) # => 3+5j
    print(complex(17)) # => 17+0j
    print(complex()) # => 0j

- **Type Casting**¬†: The process of converting one number to another.

<!-- -->

    # Using Float
    print(17)               # => 17
    print(float(17))        # => 17.0

    # Using Int
    print(17.0)             # => 17.0
    print(int(17.0))        # => 17

    # Using Str
    print(str(17.0) + ' and ' + str(17))        # => 17.0 and 17

**The arithmetic operators are the same between JS and Python, with two additions:**

- _‚Äú\*\*‚Äù¬†: Double asterisk for exponent._
- _‚Äú//‚Äù¬†: Integer Division._
- **There are no spaces between math operations in Python.**
- **Integer Division gives the other part of the number from Module; it is a way to do round down numbers replacing** `Math.floor()` **in JS.**
- **There are no** `++` **and** `--` **in Python, the only shorthand operators are:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Ez_1PZ93N4FfvkRr.png)

---

### Strings

- Python uses both single and double quotes.
- You can escape strings like so `'Jodi asked, "What\'s up, Sam?"'`
- Multiline strings use triple quotes.

<!-- -->

    print('''My instructions are very long so to make them
    more readable in the code I am putting them on
    more than one line. I can even include "quotes"
    of any kind because they won't get confused with
    the end of the string!''')

**Use the** `len()` **function to get the length of a string.**

    print(len(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù)) # => 9

### **Python uses** `zero-based indexing`

#### Python allows negative indexing (thank¬†god!)

    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[-1]) # => i

    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[-4]) # => e

- Python let‚Äôs you use ranges

You can think of this as roughly equivalent to the slice method called on a JavaScript object or string‚Ä¶ _(mind you that in JS¬†‚Ä¶ strings are wrapped in an object (under the hood)‚Ä¶ upon which the string methods are actually called. As a immutable privative type_ **\*by textbook definition\*\***, a string literal could not hope to invoke most of it‚Äôs methods without violating the state it was bound to on initialization if it were not for this bit of syntactic sugar.)\*

    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[1:4]) # => pag
    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[4:-1]) # => hett
    print(‚ÄúSpaghetti‚Äù[4:4]) # => (empty string)

- The end range is exclusive just like `slice` in JS.

<!-- -->

    # Shortcut to get from the beginning of a string to a certain index.
    print("Spaghetti"[:4])  # => Spag
    print("Spaghetti"[:-1])    # => Spaghett

    # Shortcut to get from a certain index to the end of a string.
    print("Spaghetti"[1:])  # => paghetti
    print("Spaghetti"[-4:])    # => etti

- The `index` string function is the equiv. of `indexOf()` in JS

<!-- -->

    print("Spaghetti".index("h"))    # => 4
    print("Spaghetti".index("t"))    # => 6

- The `count` function finds out how many times a substring appears in a string‚Ä¶ pretty nifty for a hard coded feature of the language.

<!-- -->

    print("Spaghetti".count("h"))    # => 1
    print("Spaghetti".count("t"))    # => 2
    print("Spaghetti".count("s"))    # => 0
    print('''We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
    not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
    serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that
    challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
    postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
    '''.count('the '))                # => 4

- **You can use** `+` **to concatenate strings, just like in JS.**
- **You can also use ‚Äú\*‚Äù to repeat strings or multiply strings.**
- **Use the** `format()` **function to use placeholders in a string to input values later on.**

<!-- -->

    first_name = "Billy"
    last_name = "Bob"
    print('Your name is {0} {1}'.format(first_name, last_name))  # => Your name is Billy Bob

- _Shorthand way to use format function is:  
  _`print(f'Your name is {first_name} {last_name}')`

#### Some useful string¬†methods.

- **Note that in JS** `join` **is used on an Array, in Python it is used on String.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*eE3E5H0AoqkhqK1z.png)

- There are also many handy testing methods.

### Variables and Expressions

- **Duck-Typing**¬†: Programming Style which avoids checking an object‚Äôs type to figure out what it can do.
- Duck Typing is the fundamental approach of Python.
- Assignment of a value automatically declares a variable.

<!-- -->

    a = 7
    b = 'Marbles'
    print(a)         # => 7
    print(b)         # => Marbles

- **_You can chain variable assignments to give multiple var names the same value._**

#### Use with caution as this is highly unreadable

    count = max = min = 0
    print(count)           # => 0
    print(max)             # => 0
    print(min)             # => 0

#### The value and type of a variable can be re-assigned at any¬†time.

    a = 17
    print(a)         # => 17
    a = 'seventeen'
    print(a)         # => seventeen

- `NaN` _does not exist in Python, but you can ‚Äòcreate‚Äô it like so:  
  _`print(float("nan"))`
- _Python replaces_ `null` _with_ `none`_._
- `none` **_is an object_** _and can be directly assigned to a variable._

> Using none is a convenient way to check to see why an action may not be operating correctly in your program.

---

### Boolean Data¬†Type

- One of the biggest benefits of Python is that it reads more like English than JS does.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HQpndNhm1Z_xSoHb.png)

    # Logical AND
    print(True and True)    # => True
    print(True and False)   # => False
    print(False and False)  # => False

    # Logical OR
    print(True or True)     # => True
    print(True or False)    # => True
    print(False or False)   # => False

    # Logical NOT
    print(not True)             # => False
    print(not False and True)   # => True
    print(not True or False)    # => False

- By default, Python considers an object to be true UNLESS it is one of the following:
- Constant `None` or `False`
- Zero of any numeric type.
- Empty Sequence or Collection.
- `True` and `False` must be capitalized

---

### Comparison Operators

- Python uses all the same equality operators as JS.
- In Python, equality operators are processed from left to right.
- Logical operators are processed in this order:

1.  **NOT**
2.  **AND**
3.  **OR**

> Just like in JS, you can use `parentheses` to change the inherent order of operations.

> **Short Circuit**¬†: Stopping a program when a `true` or `false` has been reached.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qHzGRLTOMTf30miT.png)

---

### Identity vs¬†Equality

    print (2 == '2')    # => False
    print (2 is '2')    # => False

    print ("2" == '2')    # => True
    print ("2" is '2')    # => True

    # There is a distinction between the number types.
    print (2 == 2.0)    # => True
    print (2 is 2.0)    # => False

- In the Python community it is better to use `is` and `is not` over `==` or¬†`!=`

---

### If Statements

    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')

    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')
    else:
        print('Hello, stranger.')

    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')
    elif age < 12:
        print('You are not Monica, kiddo.')
    elif age > 2000:
       print('Unlike you, Monica is not an undead, immortal vampire.')
    elif age > 100:
       print('You are not Monica, grannie.')

> Remember the order of `elif` statements matter.

---

### While Statements

    spam = 0
    while spam < 5:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1

- `Break` statement also exists in Python.

<!-- -->

    spam = 0
    while True:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1
      if spam >= 5:
        break

- As are `continue` statements

<!-- -->

    spam = 0
    while True:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1
      if spam < 5:
        continue
      break

---

### Try/Except Statements

- Python equivalent to `try/catch`

<!-- -->

    a = 321
    try:
        print(len(a))
    except:
        print('Silently handle error here')

        # Optionally include a correction to the issue
        a = str(a)
        print(len(a)

    a = '321'
    try:
        print(len(a))
    except:
        print('Silently handle error here')

        # Optionally include a correction to the issue
        a = str(a)
        print(len(a))

- You can name an error to give the output more specificity.

<!-- -->

    a = 100
    b = 0
    try:
        c = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        c = None
    print(c)

- You can also use the `pass` commmand to by pass a certain error.

<!-- -->

    a = 100
    b = 0
    try:
        print(a / b)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass

- The `pass` method won‚Äôt allow you to bypass every single error so you can chain an exception series like so:

<!-- -->

    a = 100
    # b = "5"
    try:
        print(a / b)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    except (TypeError, NameError):
        print("ERROR!")

- You can use an `else` statement to end a chain of `except` statements.

<!-- -->

    # tuple of file names
    files = ('one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt')

    # simple loop
    for filename in files:
        try:
            # open the file in read mode
            f = open(filename, 'r')
        except OSError:
            # handle the case where file does not exist or permission is denied
            print('cannot open file', filename)
        else:
            # do stuff with the file object (f)
            print(filename, 'opened successfully')
            print('found', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
            f.close()

- `finally` is used at the end to clean up all actions under any circumstance.

<!-- -->

    def divide(x, y):
        try:
            result = x / y
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Cannot divide by zero")
        else:
            print("Result is", result)
        finally:
            print("Finally...")

- Using duck typing to check to see if some value is able to use a certain method.

<!-- -->

    # Try a number - nothing will print out
    a = 321
    if hasattr(a, '__len__'):
        print(len(a))

    # Try a string - the length will print out (4 in this case)
    b = "5555"
    if hasattr(b, '__len__'):
        print(len(b))

---

### Pass

- Pass Keyword is required to write the JS equivalent of¬†:

<!-- -->

    if (true) {
    }

    while (true) {}

    if True:
      pass

    while True:
      pass

---

### Functions

- **Function definition includes:**
- **The** `def` **keyword**
- **The name of the function**
- **A list of parameters enclosed in parentheses.**
- **A colon at the end of the line.**
- **One tab indentation for the code to run.**
- **You can use default parameters just like in JS**

<!-- -->

    def greeting(name, saying="Hello"):
        print(saying, name)

    greeting("Monica")
    # Hello Monica

    greeting("Barry", "Hey")
    # Hey Barry

#### **Keep in mind, default parameters must always come after regular parameters.**

    # THIS IS BAD CODE AND WILL NOT RUN
    def increment(delta=1, value):
        return delta + value

- _You can specify arguments by name without destructuring in Python._

<!-- -->

    def greeting(name, saying="Hello"):
        print(saying, name)

    # name has no default value, so just provide the value
    # saying has a default value, so use a keyword argument
    greeting("Monica", saying="Hi")

- The `lambda` keyword is used to create anonymous functions and are supposed to be `one-liners`.

`toUpper = lambda s: s.upper()`

---

### Notes

#### Formatted Strings

> Remember that in Python join() is called on a string with an array/list passed in as the argument.  
> Python has a very powerful formatting engine.  
> format() is also applied directly to strings.

    shopping_list = [‚Äòbread‚Äô,‚Äômilk‚Äô,‚Äôeggs‚Äô]
    print(‚Äò,‚Äô.join(shopping_list))

### Comma Thousands Separator

    print(‚Äò{:,}‚Äô.format(1234567890))
    ‚Äò1,234,567,890‚Äô

### Date and¬†Time

    d = datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 4, 12, 15, 58)
    print(‚Äò{:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}‚Äô.format(d))
    ‚Äò2020-07-04 12:15:58‚Äô

### Percentage

    points = 190
    total = 220
    print(‚ÄòCorrect answers: {:.2%}‚Äô.format(points/total))
    Correct answers: 86.36%

### Data Tables

    width=8
    print(‚Äò decimal hex binary‚Äô)
    print(‚Äò-‚Äô*27)
    for num in range(1,16):
    for base in ‚ÄòdXb‚Äô:
    print(‚Äò{0:{width}{base}}‚Äô.format(num, base=base, width=width), end=‚Äô ‚Äò)
    print()
    Getting Input from the Command Line
    Python runs synchronously, all programs and processes will stop when listening for a user input.
    The input function shows a prompt to a user and waits for them to type ‚ÄòENTER‚Äô.
    Scripts vs Programs
    Programming Script : A set of code that runs in a linear fashion.
    The largest difference between scripts and programs is the level of complexity and purpose. Programs typically have many UI‚Äôs.

**Python can be used to display html, css, and JS.**  
_It is common to use Python as an API (Application Programming Interface)_

#### Structured Data

#### Sequence¬†: The most basic data structure in Python where the index determines the¬†order.

> List  
> Tuple  
> Range  
> Collections¬†: Unordered data structures, hashable values.

---

#### Dictionaries Sets

#### Iterable¬†: Generic name for a sequence or collection; any object that can be iterated¬†through.

#### Can be mutable or immutable. Built In Data¬†Types

---

### Lists are the python equivalent of¬†arrays.

    empty_list = []
    departments = [‚ÄòHR‚Äô,‚ÄôDevelopment‚Äô,‚ÄôSales‚Äô,‚ÄôFinance‚Äô,‚ÄôIT‚Äô,‚ÄôCustomer Support‚Äô]

### You can instantiate

    specials = list()

#### Test if a value is in a¬†list.

    print(1 in [1, 2, 3]) #> True
    print(4 in [1, 2, 3]) #> False
    # Tuples : Very similar to lists, but they are immutable

#### Instantiated with parentheses

    time_blocks = (‚ÄòAM‚Äô,‚ÄôPM‚Äô)

#### Sometimes instantiated without

    colors = ‚Äòred‚Äô,‚Äôblue‚Äô,‚Äôgreen‚Äô
    numbers = 1, 2, 3

#### Tuple() built in can be used to convert other data into a¬†tuple

    tuple(‚Äòabc‚Äô) # returns (‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô)
    tuple([1,2,3]) # returns (1, 2, 3)
    # Think of tuples as constant variables.

#### Ranges¬†: A list of numbers which can‚Äôt be changed; often used with for¬†loops.

**Declared using one to three parameters**.

> Start¬†: opt. default 0, first \# in sequence.  
> Stop¬†: required next number past the last number in the sequence.  
> Step¬†: opt. default 1, difference between each number in the sequence.

    range(5) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(1,5) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(0, 25, 5) # [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]
    range(0) # [ ]
    for let (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for let (i = 1; i < 5; i++)
    for let (i = 0; i < 25; i+=5)
    for let(i = 0; i = 0; i++)
    # Keep in mind that stop is not included in the range.

#### Dictionaries¬†: Mappable collection where a hashable value is used as a key to ref. an object stored in the dictionary.

#### Mutable.

    a = {‚Äòone‚Äô:1, ‚Äòtwo‚Äô:2, ‚Äòthree‚Äô:3}
    b = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
    c = dict([(‚Äòtwo‚Äô, 2), (‚Äòone‚Äô, 1), (‚Äòthree‚Äô, 3)])
    # a, b, and c are all equal

**_Declared with curly braces of the built in dict()_**

> _Benefit of dictionaries in Python is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how it is defined, if the keys and values are the same the dictionaries are considered equal._

**Use the in operator to see if a key exists in a dictionary.**

S**ets¬†: Unordered collection of distinct objects; objects that need to be hashable.**

> _Always be unique, duplicate items are auto dropped from the set._

#### Common Uses:

> Removing Duplicates  
> Membership Testing  
> Mathematical Operators: Intersection, Union, Difference, Symmetric Difference.

**Standard Set is mutable, Python has a immutable version called frozenset.  
Sets created by putting comma seperated values inside braces:**

    school_bag = {‚Äòbook‚Äô,‚Äôpaper‚Äô,‚Äôpencil‚Äô,‚Äôpencil‚Äô,‚Äôbook‚Äô,‚Äôbook‚Äô,‚Äôbook‚Äô,‚Äôeraser‚Äô}
    print(school_bag)

#### Also can use set constructor to automatically put it into a¬†set.

    letters = set(‚Äòabracadabra‚Äô)
    print(letters)
    #Built-In Functions
    #Functions using iterables

**filter(function, iterable)¬†: creates new iterable of the same type which includes each item for which the function returns true.**

**map(function, iterable)¬†: creates new iterable of the same type which includes the result of calling the function on every item of the iterable.**

**sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)¬†: creates a new sorted list from the items in the iterable.**

**Output is always a list**

**key: opt function which coverts and item to a value to be compared.**

**reverse: optional boolean.**

**enumerate(iterable, start=0)¬†: starts with a sequence and converts it to a series of tuples**

    quarters = [‚ÄòFirst‚Äô, ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô, ‚ÄòThird‚Äô, ‚ÄòFourth‚Äô]
    print(enumerate(quarters))
    print(enumerate(quarters, start=1))

#### (0, ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô), (1, ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô), (2, ‚ÄòThird‚Äô), (3, ‚ÄòFourth‚Äô)

#### (1, ‚ÄòFirst‚Äô), (2, ‚ÄòSecond‚Äô), (3, ‚ÄòThird‚Äô), (4, ‚ÄòFourth‚Äô)

> zip(\*iterables)¬†: creates a zip object filled with tuples that combine 1 to 1 the items in each provided iterable.  
> Functions that analyze iterable

**len(iterable)¬†: returns the count of the number of items.**

**max(\*args, key=None)¬†: returns the largest of two or more arguments.**

**max(iterable, key=None)¬†: returns the largest item in the iterable.**

_key optional function which converts an item to a value to be compared.  
min works the same way as max_

**sum(iterable)¬†: used with a list of numbers to generate the total.**

_There is a faster way to concatenate an array of strings into one string, so do not use sum for that._

**any(iterable)¬†: returns True if any items in the iterable are true.**

**all(iterable)¬†: returns True is all items in the iterable are true.**

### Working with dictionaries

**dir(dictionary)¬†: returns the list of keys in the dictionary.  
Working with sets**

**Union¬†: The pipe | operator or union(\*sets) function can be used to produce a new set which is a combination of all elements in the provided set.**

    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a | b) # => {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}

#### Intersection¬†: The & operator ca be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in all¬†sets.

    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a & b) # => {2}
    Difference : The ‚Äî operator can be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in the first set and NOT the others.

**Symmetric Difference¬†: The ^ operator can be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in exactly one set and not in both.**

    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a ‚Äî b) # => {1, 3}
    print(b ‚Äî a) # => {4, 6}
    print(a ^ b) # => {1, 3, 4, 6}

---

### **For Statements In python, there is only one for¬†loop.**

Always Includes:

> 1. The for keyword
> 2. A variable name
> 3. The ‚Äòin‚Äô keyword
> 4. An iterable of some kid
> 5. A colon
> 6. On the next line, an indented block of code called the for clause.

**You can use break and continue statements inside for loops as well.**

**You can use the range function as the iterable for the for loop.**

    print(‚ÄòMy name is‚Äô)
    for i in range(5):
    print(‚ÄòCarlita Cinco (‚Äò + str(i) + ‚Äò)‚Äô)

    total = 0
    for num in range(101):
    total += num
    print(total)
    Looping over a list in Python
    for c in [‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòb‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô]:
    print(c)

    lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    for i in lst:
    print(i)

**_Common technique is to use the len() on a pre-defined list with a for loop to iterate over the indices of the list._**

    supplies = [‚Äòpens‚Äô, ‚Äòstaplers‚Äô, ‚Äòflame-throwers‚Äô, ‚Äòbinders‚Äô]
    for i in range(len(supplies)):
    print(‚ÄòIndex ‚Äò + str(i) + ‚Äò in supplies is: ‚Äò + supplies[i])

**You can loop and destructure at the same time.**

    l = 1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6
    for a, b in l:
    print(a, ‚Äò, ‚Äò, b)

> Prints 1, 2

> Prints 3, 4

> Prints 5, 6

**You can use values() and keys() to loop over dictionaries.**

    spam = {‚Äòcolor‚Äô: ‚Äòred‚Äô, ‚Äòage‚Äô: 42}
    for v in spam.values():
    print(v)

_Prints red_

_Prints 42_

    for k in spam.keys():
    print(k)

_Prints color_

_Prints age_

**For loops can also iterate over both keys and values.**

**Getting tuples**

    for i in spam.items():
    print(i)

_Prints (‚Äòcolor‚Äô, ‚Äòred‚Äô)_

_Prints (‚Äòage‚Äô, 42)_

_Destructuring to values_

    for k, v in spam.items():
    print(‚ÄòKey: ‚Äò + k + ‚Äò Value: ‚Äò + str(v))

_Prints Key: age Value: 42_

_Prints Key: color Value: red_

**Looping over string**

    for c in ‚Äúabcdefg‚Äù:
    print(c)

**When you order arguments within a function or function call, the args need to occur in a particular order:**

_formal positional args._

\*args

_keyword args with default values_

\*\*kwargs

    def example(arg_1, arg_2, *args, **kwargs):
    pass

    def example2(arg_1, arg_2, *args, kw_1=‚Äùshark‚Äù, kw_2=‚Äùblowfish‚Äù, **kwargs):
    pass

### **Importing in¬†Python**

**Modules are similar to packages in Node.js**  
Come in different types:

Built-In,

Third-Party,

Custom.

**All loaded using import statements.**

---

### **Terms**

> module¬†: Python code in a separate file.  
> package¬†: Path to a directory that contains modules.  
> [**init.py**](http://init.py/)¬†: Default file for a package.  
> submodule¬†: Another file in a module‚Äôs folder.  
> function¬†: Function in a module.

**A module can be any file but it is usually created by placing a special file init.py into a folder. pic**

_Try to avoid importing with wildcards in Python._

_Use multiple lines for clarity when importing._

    from urllib.request import (
    HTTPDefaultErrorHandler as ErrorHandler,
    HTTPRedirectHandler as RedirectHandler,
    Request,
    pathname2url,
    url2pathname,
    urlopen,
    )

---

### Watching Out for Python¬†2

**Python 3 removed &lt;&gt; and only uses¬†!=**

**format() was introduced with P3**

**All strings in P3 are unicode and encoded.  
md5 was removed.**

## [Fetch Quick Sheet](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/05/fetch-quick-sheet/)

### Fetch

    fetch('/data.json')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
      })
      .catch(err => ...)

### Response

    fetch('/data.json')
    .then(res => {
      res.text()       // response body (=> Promise)
      res.json()       // parse via JSON (=> Promise)
      res.status       //=> 200
      res.statusText   //=> 'OK'
      res.redirected   //=> false
      res.ok           //=> true
      res.url          //=> 'http://site.com/data.json'
      res.type         //=> 'basic'
                       //   ('cors' 'default' 'error'
                       //    'opaque' 'opaqueredirect')

      res.headers.get('Content-Type')
    })

### Request options

    fetch('/data.json', {
      method: 'post',
      body: new FormData(form), // post body
      body: JSON.stringify(...),

      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json'
      },

      credentials: 'same-origin', // send cookies
      credentials: 'include',     // send cookies, even in CORS

    })

### Catching errors

    fetch('/data.json')
      .then(checkStatus)

    function checkStatus (res) {
      if (res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300) {
        return res
      } else {
        let err = new Error(res.statusText)
        err.response = res
        throw err
      }
    }

Non-2xx responses are still successful requests. Use another function to turn them to errors.

### Using with¬†node.js

    const fetch = require('isomorphic-fetch')

See: [isomorphic-fetch](https://npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) _(npmjs.com)_

## [Deploy React App To Heroku Using Postgres &¬†Express](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/05/deploy-react-app-to-heroku-using-postgres-express/)

Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

<https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/7bf839da876126324957e1f0f0feb578>

Before you begin deploying, make sure to remove any `console.log`‚Äòs or `debugger`‚Äòs in any production code. You can search your entire project folder if you are using them anywhere.

You will set up Heroku to run on a production, not development, version of your application. When a Node.js application like yours is pushed up to Heroku, it is identified as a Node.js application because of the `package.json` file. It runs `npm install` automatically. Then, if there is a `heroku-postbuild` script in the `package.json` file, it will run that script. Afterwards, it will automatically run `npm start`.

In the following phases, you will configure your application to work in production, not just in development, and configure the `package.json` scripts for `install`, `heroku-postbuild` and `start` scripts to install, build your React application, and start the Express production server.

### Phase 1: Heroku Connection

If you haven‚Äôt created a Heroku account yet, create one [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

Add a new application in your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) named whatever you want. Under the ‚ÄúResources‚Äù tab in your new application, click ‚ÄúFind more add-ons‚Äù and add the ‚ÄúHeroku Postgres‚Äù add-on with the free Hobby Dev setting.

In your terminal, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line). Afterwards, login to Heroku in your terminal by running the following:

    heroku login

Add Heroku as a remote to your project‚Äôs git repository in the following command and replace `<name-of-Heroku-app>` with the name of the application you created in the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

    heroku git:remote -a <name-of-Heroku-app>

Next, you will set up your Express + React application to be deployable to Heroku.

### Phase 2: Setting up your Express + React application

Right now, your React application is on a different localhost port than your Express application. However, since your React application only consists of static files that don‚Äôt need to bundled continuously with changes in production, your Express application can serve the React assets in production too. These static files live in the `frontend/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder.

Add the following changes into your `backend/routes.index.js` file.

At the root route, serve the React application‚Äôs static `index.html` file along with `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. Then serve up all the React application‚Äôs static files using the `express.static` middleware. Serve the `index.html` and set the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie again on all routes that don‚Äôt start in `/api`. You should already have this set up in `backend/routes/index.js` which should now look like this:

    // backend/routes/index.js
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();
    const apiRouter = require('./api');

    router.use('/api', apiRouter);

    // Static routes
    // Serve React build files in production
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      const path = require('path');
      // Serve the frontend's index.html file at the root route
      router.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.sendFile(
          path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
        );
      });

      // Serve the static assets in the frontend's build folder
      router.use(express.static(path.resolve("../frontend/build")));

      // Serve the frontend's index.html file at all other routes NOT starting with /api
      router.get(/^(?!\/?api).*/, (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.sendFile(
          path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
        );
      });
    }

    // Add a XSRF-TOKEN cookie in development
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      router.get('/api/csrf/restore', (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.status(201).json({});
      });
    }

    module.exports = router;

Your Express backend‚Äôs `package.json` should include scripts to run the `sequelize` CLI commands.

The `backend/package.json`‚Äòs scripts should now look like this:

    "scripts": {
        "sequelize": "sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "sequelize-cli",
        "start": "per-env",
        "start:development": "nodemon -r dotenv/config ./bin/www",
        "start:production": "node ./bin/www"
      },

Initialize a `package.json` file at the very root of your project directory (outside of both the `backend` and `frontend` folders). The scripts defined in this `package.json` file will be run by Heroku, not the scripts defined in the `backend/package.json` or the `frontend/package.json`.

When Heroku runs `npm install`, it should install packages for both the `backend` and the `frontend`. Overwrite the `install` script in the root `package.json` with:

    npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend

This will run `npm install` in the `backend` folder then run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.

Next, define a `heroku-postbuild` script that will run the `npm run build` command in the `frontend` folder. Remember, Heroku will automatically run this script after running `npm install`.

Define a `sequelize` script that will run `npm run sequelize` in the `backend` folder.

Finally, define a `start` that will run `npm start` in the \`backend folder.

The root `package.json`‚Äòs scripts should look like this:

    "scripts": {
        "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build --prefix frontend",
        "install": "npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend",
        "dev:backend": "npm install --prefix backend start",
        "dev:frontend": "npm install --prefix frontend start",
        "sequelize": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize-cli",
        "start": "npm start --prefix backend"
      },

The `dev:backend` and `dev:frontend` scripts are optional and will not be used for Heroku.

Finally, commit your changes.

### Phase 3: Deploy to¬†Heroku

Once you‚Äôre finished setting this up, navigate to your application‚Äôs Heroku dashboard. Under ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù there is a section for ‚ÄúConfig Vars‚Äù. Click the `Reveal Config Vars` button to see all your production environment variables. You should have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable already from the Heroku Postgres add-on.

Add environment variables for `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and `JWT_SECRET` and any other environment variables you need for production.

You can also set environment variables through the Heroku CLI you installed earlier in your terminal. See the docs for [Setting Heroku Config Variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

Push your project to Heroku. Heroku only allows the `master` branch to be pushed. But, you can alias your branch to be named `master` when pushing to Heroku. For example, to push a branch called `login-branch` to `master` run:

    git push heroku login-branch:master

If you do want to push the `master` branch, just run:

    git push heroku master

You may want to make two applications on Heroku, the `master` branch site that should have working code only. And your `staging` site that you can use to test your work in progress code.

Now you need to migrate and seed your production database.

Using the Heroku CLI, you can run commands inside of your production application just like in development using the `heroku run` command.

For example to migrate the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:migrate

To seed the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:seed:all

Note: You can interact with your database this way as you‚Äôd like, but beware that `db:drop` cannot be run in the Heroku environment. If you want to drop and create the database, you need to remove and add back the ‚ÄúHeroku Postgres‚Äù add-on.

Another way to interact with the production application is by opening a bash shell through your terminal by running:

    heroku bash

In the opened shell, you can run things like `npm run sequelize db:migrate`.

Open your deployed site and check to see if you successfully deployed your Express + React application to Heroku!

If you see an `Application Error` or are experiencing different behavior than what you see in your local environment, check the logs by running:

    heroku logs

If you want to open a connection to the logs to continuously output to your terminal, then run:

    heroku logs --tail

The logs may clue you into why you are experiencing errors or different behavior.

## [Postgresql Cheat Sheet](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/03/05/postgresql-cheat-sheet/)

#### [CODEX](http://medium.com/codex)

#### **Each table is made up of rows and columns. If you think of a table as a grid, the column go from left to right across the grid and each entry of data is listed down as a¬†row.**

Each row in a relational is uniquely identified by a primary key. This can be by one or more sets of column values. In most scenarios it is a single column, such as employeeID.

Every relational table has one primary key. Its purpose is to uniquely identify each row in the database. No two rows can have the same primary key value. The practical result of this is that you can select every single row by just knowing its primary key.

SQL Server UNIQUE constraints allow you to ensure that the data stored in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among the rows in a table.

Although both UNIQUE and [PRIMARY KEY](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-primary-key/) constraints enforce the uniqueness of data, you should use the UNIQUE constraint instead of PRIMARY KEY constraint when you want to enforce the uniqueness of a column, or a group of columns, that are not the primary key columns.

Different from PRIMARY KEY constraints, UNIQUE constraints allow NULL. Moreover, UNIQUE constraints treat the NULL as a regular value, therefore, it only allows one NULL per column.

### Postgres &¬†JSON:

### Creating the DB and the¬†Table

    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db WITH ENCODING='UTF8' TEMPLATE template0;

    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;

    CREATE TABLE books (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      client VARCHAR NOT NULL,
      data JSONb NOT NULL
    );

### Populating the¬†DB

    INSERT INTO books(client, data) values( 'Joe', '{ "title": "Siddhartha", "author": { "first_name": "Herman", "last_name": "Hesse" } }' ); INSERT INTO books(client, data) values('Jenny', '{ "title": "Bryan Guner", "author": { "first_name": "Jack", "last_name": "Kerouac" } }'); INSERT INTO books(client, data) values('Jenny', '{ "title": "100 a√±os de soledad", "author": { "first_name": "Gabo", "last_name": "Marqu√©z" } }');

Lets see everything inside the table books:

    SELECT * FROM books;

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GOQQ0qNGak2yIrtQ)

### `->` operator returns values out of JSON¬†columns

Selecting 1 column:

    SELECT client,
        data->'title' AS title
        FROM books;

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OIVYOfYcbVh65Mt5)

Selecting 2 columns:

    SELECT client,
       data->'title' AS title, data->'author' AS author
       FROM books;

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fEzPkSY8yGexKOk4)

### `->` vs¬†`->>`

The `->` operator returns the original JSON type (which might be an object), whereas `->>` returns text.

### Return NESTED¬†objects

You can use the `->` to return a nested object and thus chain the operators:

    SELECT client,
       data->'author'->'last_name' AS author
       FROM books;

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*lwy8bR7igaroMXeb)

### Filtering

Select rows based on a value inside your JSON:

    SELECT
     client,
     data->'title' AS title
     FROM books
      WHERE data->'title' = '"Bryan Guner"';

Notice WHERE uses `->` so we must compare to JSON `'"Bryan Guner"'`

Or we could use `->>` and compare to `'Bryan Guner'`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*poASndLoU71qlXqE)

### Nested filtering

Find rows based on the value of a nested JSON object:

    SELECT
     client,
     data->'title' AS title
     FROM books
      WHERE data->'author'->>'last_name' = 'Kerouac';

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*R1kOhDK19ntdUYkq)

### A real world¬†example

    CREATE TABLE events (
      name varchar(200),
      visitor_id varchar(200),
      properties json,
      browser json
    );

We‚Äôre going to store events in this table, like pageviews. Each event has properties, which could be anything (e.g. current page) and also sends information about the browser (like OS, screen resolution, etc). Both of these are completely free form and could change over time (as we think of extra stuff to track).

    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'pageview', '1',
      '{ "page": "/" }',
      '{ "name": "Chrome", "os": "Mac", "resolution": { "x": 1440, "y": 900 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'pageview', '2',
      '{ "page": "/" }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1920, "y": 1200 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'pageview', '1',
      '{ "page": "/account" }',
      '{ "name": "Chrome", "os": "Mac", "resolution": { "x": 1440, "y": 900 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'purchase', '5',
      '{ "amount": 10 }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1024, "y": 768 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'purchase', '15',
      '{ "amount": 200 }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1280, "y": 800 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'purchase', '15',
      '{ "amount": 500 }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1280, "y": 800 } }'
    );

Now lets select everything:

    SELECT * FROM events;

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZPHfB4FxjSIlAVxL)

### JSON operators + PostgreSQL aggregate functions

Using the JSON operators, combined with traditional PostgreSQL aggregate functions, we can pull out whatever we want. You have the full might of an RDBMS at your disposal.

- Lets see browser usage:
- `SELECT browser->>'name' AS browser, count(browser) FROM events GROUP BY browser->>'name';`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4lEv2DgUk33FeUgo)

- Total revenue per visitor:

`SELECT visitor_id, SUM(CAST(properties->>'amount' AS integer)) AS total FROM events WHERE CAST(properties->>'amount' AS integer) > 0 GROUP BY visitor_id;`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HxOS3CgwXBJ6A2FP)

- Average screen resolution
- `SELECT AVG(CAST(browser->'resolution'->>'x' AS integer)) AS width, AVG(CAST(browser->'resolution'->>'y' AS integer)) AS height FROM events;`

Output:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iyv4Iv4Rc8M8mwt1)

## [A Quick Guide to Big-O Notation, Memoization, Tabulation, and Sorting Algorithms by¬†Example](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/02/27/a-quick-guide-to-big-o-notation-memoization-tabulation-and-sorting-algorithms-by-example/)

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/fe4be-0yjlsk3t9c2_14in1.png)

**_Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation_**

- Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of calculating time complexity?
- Not all computers are made equal( some may be stronger and therefore boost our runtime speed )
- How many background processes ran concurrently with our program that was being tested?
- We also need to ask if our code remains performant if we increase the size of the input.
- The real question we need to answering is: `How does our performance scale?`.

### big ‚ÄòO‚Äô¬†notation

- Big O Notation is a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input arguments.
- Since we use mathematical functions in Big-O, there are a few big picture ideas that we‚Äôll want to keep in mind:
- The function should be defined by the size of the input.
- `Smaller` Big O is better (lower time complexity)
- Big O is used to describe the worst case scenario.
- Big O is simplified to show only its most dominant mathematical term.

### Simplifying Math¬†Terms

- We can use the following rules to simplify the our Big O functions:
- `Simplify Products`¬†: If the function is a product of many terms, we drop the terms that don‚Äôt depend on n.
- `Simplify Sums`¬†: If the function is a sum of many terms, we drop the non-dominant terms.
- `n`¬†: size of the input
- `T(f)`¬†: unsimplified math function
- `O(f)`¬†: simplified math function.

`Putting it all together`

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/cb689-1tt8uuv1x3nmguw5rvtoz8a.png)

- First we apply the product rule to drop all constants.
- Then we apply the sum rule to select the single most dominant term.

### Complexity Classes

Common Complexity Classes

#### There are 7 major classes in Time Complexity

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/c2e27-16zkhmjohkvdbrd8jfudf3a.png)

#### `O(1) Constant`

> **The algorithm takes roughly the same number of steps for any input size.**

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/91b823971e8faac788f38ff670efc19d#file-constant-js>

#### `O(log(n)) Logarithmic`

> **In most cases our hidden base of Logarithmic time is 2, log complexity algorithm‚Äôs will typically display ‚Äòhalving‚Äô the size of the input (like binary search!)**

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/a1e6dec81f0639818db7f9a8e76b3992>

#### `O(n) Linear`

> **Linear algorithm‚Äôs will access each item of the input ‚Äúonce‚Äù.**

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/cc953ba2bd6e1d6f524a6d8b297aad5b>

### `O(nlog(n)) Log Linear Time`

> **Combination of linear and logarithmic behavior, we will see features from both classes.**

> Algorithm‚Äôs that are log-linear will use **both recursion AND iteration.**

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/e9bd6337c17f1623a4da088574ed0d8e>

### `O(nc) Polynomial`

> **C is a fixed constant.**

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/3e6096e66bac80b962435b7d873cdbe9>

### `O(c^n) Exponential`

> **C is now the number of recursive calls made in each stack frame.**

> **Algorithm‚Äôs with exponential time are VERY SLOW.**

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/5dec7e3736d7b5e28a5f1c85b5b50705>

---

### Memoization

- Memoization¬†: a design pattern used to reduce the overall number of calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive strategies to solve.
- MZ stores the results of the sub-problems in some other data structure, so that we can avoid duplicate calculations and only ‚Äòsolve‚Äô each problem once.
- Two features that comprise memoization:

1.  FUNCTION MUST BE RECURSIVE.
2.  Our additional Data Structure is usually an object (we refer to it as our memo‚Ä¶ or sometimes cache!)

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/d40c8-14u79jbmju2wke_tyycd_3a.png)

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/07644-1qh42kzgccxmvt6wrtascvw.png)

### Memoizing Factorial

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/0f92023740a44e3b41a0defb227ade37#file-memoizing-factorial-js>

Our memo object is _mapping_ out our arguments of factorial to it‚Äôs return value.

- Keep in mind we didn‚Äôt improve the speed of our algorithm.

### Memoizing Fibonacci

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2XaPj7UGKZYFjYhb)

- Our time complexity for Fibonacci goes from O(2^n) to O(n) after applying memoization.

### The Memoization Formula

> _Rules:_

1.  _Write the unoptimized brute force recursion (make sure it works);_
2.  _Add memo object as an additional argument¬†._
3.  _Add a base case condition that returns the stored value if the function‚Äôs argument is in the memo._
4.  _Before returning the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a value and make the function‚Äôs argument it‚Äôs key._

#### Things to¬†remember

1.  _When solving DP problems with Memoization, it is helpful to draw out the visual tree first._
2.  _When you notice duplicate sub-tree‚Äôs that means we can memoize._

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/c15feb228a51a3543625009c8fd0b6de>

---

### Tabulation

#### Tabulation Strategy

> Use When:

- **The function is iterative and not recursive.**
- _The accompanying DS is usually an array._

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/a57bf449f5a8b16eedd1aa9fd71707e2>

#### Steps for tabulation

- _Create a table array based off the size of the input._
- _Initialize some values in the table to ‚Äòanswer‚Äô the trivially small subproblem._
- _Iterate through the array and fill in the remaining entries._
- _Your final answer is usually the last entry in the table._

---

### Memo and Tab Demo with Fibonacci

> _Normal Recursive Fibonacci_

    function fibonacci(n) {
      if (n <= 2) return 1;
      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

> _Memoization Fibonacci 1_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/504a9120ca40bbb4a246549937c43a12>

> _Memoization Fibonacci 2_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/07d315d92b3458a8640cee31bce9c236>

> _Tabulated Fibonacci_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/b1b1f7e259193ecdc432350b6199f2d3>

### Example of Linear¬†Search

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/e98354b287ce2f80da4ab943399eb555>

- _Worst Case Scenario: The term does not even exist in the array._
- _Meaning: If it doesn‚Äôt exist then our for loop would run until the end therefore making our time complexity O(n)._

---

### Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

- The inner for-loop contributes to O(n), however in a worst case scenario the while loop will need to run n times before bringing all n elements to their final resting spot.

`Space Complexity`: O(1)

- Bubble Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ck9aeGY-d5tbz7dT)

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/e67e56bed7c5a20a54851867ba5efef6>

- The first major sorting algorithm one learns in introductory programming courses.
- Gives an intro on how to convert unsorted data into sorted data.

> It‚Äôs almost never used in production code because:

- _It‚Äôs not efficient_
- _It‚Äôs not commonly used_
- _There is stigma attached to it_
- `Bubbling Up`_¬†: Term that infers that an item is in motion, moving in some direction, and has some final resting destination._
- _Bubble sort, sorts an array of integers by bubbling the largest integer to the top._

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/fd4acc0c89033bd219ebf9d3ec40b053><https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/80934783c628c70ac2a5a48119a82d54>

- _Worst Case & Best Case are always the same because it makes nested loops._
- _Double for loops are polynomial time complexity or more specifically in this case Quadratic (Big O) of: O(n¬≤)_

### Selection Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n¬≤);

`Space Complexity`: O(1)

- Selection Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AByxtBjFrPVVYmyu)

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/4abc0fe0bf01599b0c4104b0ba633402>

- Selection sort organizes the smallest elements to the start of the array.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GeYNxlRcbt2cf0rY)

> Summary of how Selection Sort should work:

1.  _Set MIN to location 0_
2.  _Search the minimum element in the list._
3.  _Swap with value at location Min_
4.  _Increment Min to point to next element._
5.  _Repeat until list is sorted._

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/61f130c8e0097572ed908fe2629bdee0>

### Insertion Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n¬≤);

`Space Complexity`: O(n)

- Because we are creating a subArray for each element in the original input, our Space Comlexity becomes linear.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gbNU6wrszGPrfAZG)

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/a9f4b8596c7546ac92746db659186d8c>

### Merge Sort

`Time Complexity`: Log Linear O(nlog(n))

- Since our array gets split in half every single time we contribute O(log(n)). The while loop contained in our helper merge function contributes O(n) therefore our time complexity is O(nlog(n)); `Space Complexity`: O(n)
- We are linear O(n) time because we are creating subArrays.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GeU8YwwCoK8GiSTD)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IxqGb72XDVDeeiMl)

### Example of Merge¬†Sort

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/18fbb7edc9f5c4820ccfcecacf3c5e48><https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/cbb533137a7f957d3bc4077395c1ff64>

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HMCR--9niDt5zY6M)

- **Merge sort is O(nlog(n)) time.**
- _We need a function for merging and a function for sorting._

> Steps:

1.  _If there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted; return the array._
2.  _Otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no longer be divided._
3.  _Merge the smallest lists into new list in a sorted order._

### Quick Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Even though the average time complexity O(nLog(n)), the worst case scenario is always quadratic.

`Space Complexity`: O(n)

- Our space complexity is linear O(n) because of the partition arrays we create.
- QS is another Divide and Conquer strategy.
- Some key ideas to keep in mind:
- It is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value.
- An array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted.

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/24bcbc5248a8c4e1671945e9512da57e>

### Binary Search

`Time Complexity`: Log Time O(log(n))

`Space Complexity`: O(1)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-naVYGTXzE2Yoali)

> _Recursive Solution_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/c82c00a4bcba4b69b7d326d6cad3ac8c>

> _Min Max Solution_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/eb8d1e1684db15cc2c8af28e13f38751><https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/bc3f576b9795ccef12a108e36f9f820a>

- _Must be conducted on a sorted array._
- _Binary search is logarithmic time, not exponential b/c n is cut down by two, not growing._
- _Binary Search is part of Divide and Conquer._

### Insertion Sort

- **Works by building a larger and larger sorted region at the left-most end of the array.**

> Steps:

1.  _If it is the first element, and it is already sorted; return 1._
2.  _Pick next element._
3.  _Compare with all elements in the sorted sub list_
4.  _Shift all the elements in the sorted sub list that is greater than the value to be sorted._
5.  _Insert the value_
6.  _Repeat until list is sorted._

## [Basic Web Development Environment¬†Setup](https://web-dev-hub.com/2021/02/26/basic-web-development-environment-setup/)

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and¬†Ubuntu

‚Äå

![](https://webdevhubcom.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/d44d1-0aqkp1drnhmnm34zz.jpg)

Test if you have Ubuntu installed by typing ‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads ‚ÄúType here to search‚Äù. If you see a search result that reads **‚ÄúUbuntu 20.04 LTS‚Äù** with ‚ÄúApp‚Äù under it, then you have it installed.

‚Äå

1.  In the application search box in the bottom bar, type ‚ÄúPowerShell‚Äù to find the application named ‚ÄúWindows PowerShell‚Äù
2.  Right-click on ‚ÄúWindows PowerShell‚Äù and choose ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù from the popup menu
3.  In the blue PowerShell window, type the following: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`
4.  Restart your computer
5.  In the application search box in the bottom bar, type ‚ÄúStore‚Äù to find the application named ‚ÄúMicrosoft Store‚Äù
6.  Click ‚ÄúMicrosoft Store‚Äù
7.  Click the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button in the upper-right corner of the window
8.  Type in ‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù
9.  Click ‚ÄúRun Linux on Windows (Get the apps)‚Äù
10. Click the orange tile labeled **‚ÄúUbuntu‚Äù** Note that there are 3 versions in the Microsoft Store‚Ä¶ you want the one just entitled ‚ÄòUbuntu‚Äô
11. Click ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù
12. After it downloads, click ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù
13. If you get the option, pin the application to the task bar. Otherwise, right-click on the orange Ubuntu icon in the task bar and choose ‚ÄúPin to taskbar‚Äù
14. When prompted to ‚ÄúEnter new UNIX username‚Äù, type your first name with no spaces
15. When prompted, enter and retype a password for this UNIX user (it can be the same as your Windows password)
16. Confirm your installation by typing the command `whoami ‚Äòas in who-am-i'`followed by Enter at the prompt (it should print your first name)
17. You need to update your packages, so type `sudo apt update` (if prompted for your password, enter it)
18. You need to upgrade your packages, so type `sudo apt upgrade` (if prompted for your password, enter it)

### Git

Git comes with Ubuntu, so there‚Äôs nothing to install. However, you should configure it using the following instructions.

‚ÄåOpen an Ubuntu terminal if you don‚Äôt have one open already.

1.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` with replacing ‚ÄúYour Name‚Äù with your real name.
2.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.email your@email.com` with replacing ‚Äú<your@email.com>‚Äù with your real email.

**Note: if you want git to remember your login credentials type:**

    $ git config --global credential.helper store

‚Äå

### Google Chrome

Test if you have Chrome installed by typing ‚ÄúChrome‚Äù in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads ‚ÄúType here to search‚Äù. If you see a search result that reads ‚ÄúChrome‚Äù with ‚ÄúApp‚Äù under it, then you have it installed. Otherwise, follow these instructions to install Google Chrome.

‚Äå

1.  Open Microsoft Edge, the blue ‚Äúe‚Äù in the task bar, and type in [http://chrome.google.com](http://chrome.google.com/). Click the ‚ÄúDownload Chrome‚Äù button. Click the ‚ÄúAccept and Install‚Äù button after reading the terms of service. Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù in the ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do with ChromeSetup.exe‚Äù dialog at the bottom of the window. When you have the option to ‚ÄúRun‚Äù it, do so. Answer the questions as you‚Äôd like. Set it as the default browser.
2.  Right-click on the Chrome icon in the task bar and choose ‚ÄúPin to taskbar‚Äù.

### Node.js

Test if you have Node.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `node --version`. If it reports ‚ÄúCommand ‚Äònode‚Äô not found‚Äù, then you need to follow these directions.

1.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt update` and press Enter
2.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt install build-essential` and press Enter
3.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash` and press Enter
4.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type¬†`. ./.bashrc` and press Enter
5.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `nvm install --lts` and press Enter
6.  Confirm that **node** is installed by typing `node --version` and seeing it print something that is not ‚ÄúCommand not found‚Äù!

### Unzip

You will often have to download a zip file and unzip it. It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux unzip utility.

‚ÄåIn the Ubuntu terminal type: `sudo apt install unzip` and press Enter

‚ÄåMocha.js

Test if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `which mocha`. If it prints a path, then you‚Äôre good. Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing `npm install -g mocha`.

‚Äå

### Python 3

Ubuntu does not come with Python 3. Install it using the command `sudo apt install python3`. Test it by typing `python3 --version` and seeing it print a number.

‚Äå

### Note about¬†WSL

‚Äå

As of the time of writing of this document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you **close** Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal.

‚Äå

## [Music & Mood](https://web-dev-hub.com/2019/03/11/music-affects-mood-l4fkm/)

It all begins with an idea. Maybe you want to launch a business. Maybe you want to turn a hobby into something more. Or maybe you have a creative project to share with the world. Whatever it is, the way you tell your story online can make all the difference.

Don‚Äôt worry about sounding professional. Sound like you. There are over 1.5 billion websites out there, but your story is what‚Äôs going to separate this one from the rest. If you read the words back and don‚Äôt hear your own voice in your head, that‚Äôs a good sign you still have more work to do.

Be clear, be confident and don‚Äôt overthink it. The beauty of your story is that it‚Äôs going to continue to evolve and your site can evolve with it. Your goal should be to make it feel right for right now. Later will take care of itself. It always does.
